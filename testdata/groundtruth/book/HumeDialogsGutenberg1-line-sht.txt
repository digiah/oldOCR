Dialogues Concerning Natural ReligionbyDavid HumePAMPHILUS TO HERMIPPUSIt has been remarked, my HERMIPPUS, that though the ancient philosophersconveyed most of their instruction in the form of dialogue, this methodof composition has been little practised in later ages, and has seldomsucceeded in the hands of those who have attempted it. Accurate andregular argument, indeed, such as is now expected of philosophicalinquirers, naturally throws a man into the methodical and didacticmanner; where he can immediately, without preparation, explain the pointat which he aims; and thence proceed, without interruption, to deducethe proofs on which it is established. To deliver a SYSTEM inconversation, scarcely appears natural; and while the dialogue-writerdesires, by departing from the direct style of composition, to give afreer air to his performance, and avoid the appearance of Author andReader, he is apt to run into a worse inconvenience, and convey theimage of Pedagogue and Pupil. Or, if he carries on the dispute in thenatural spirit of good company, by throwing in a variety of topics, andpreserving a proper balance among the speakers, he often loses so muchtime in preparations and transitions, that the reader will scarcelythink himself compensated, by all the graces of dialogue, for the order,brevity, and precision, which are sacrificed to them.There are some subjects, however, to which dialogue-writing is peculiarlyadapted, and where it is still preferable to the direct and simple methodof composition.Any point of doctrine, which is so obvious that it scarcely admits ofdispute, but at the same time so important that it cannot be too ofteninculcated, seems to require some such method of handling it; where thenovelty of the manner may compensate the triteness of the subject; wherethe vivacity of conversation may enforce the precept; and where thevariety of lights, presented by various personages and characters, mayappear neither tedious nor redundant.Any question of philosophy, on the other hand, which is so OBSCURE andUNCERTAIN, that human reason can reach no fixed determination with regardto it; if it should be treated at all, seems to lead us naturally intothe style of dialogue and conversation. Reasonable men may be allowed todiffer, where no one can reasonably be positive. Opposite sentiments,even without any decision, afford an agreeable amusement; and if thesubject be curious and interesting, the book carries us, in a manner,into company; and unites the two greatest and purest pleasures of humanlife, study and society.Happily, these circumstances are all to be found in the subject ofNATURAL RELIGION. What truth so obvious, so certain, as the being of aGod, which the most ignorant ages have acknowledged, for which the mostrefined geniuses have ambitiously striven to produce new proofs andarguments? What truth so important as this, which is the ground of allour hopes, the surest foundation of morality, the firmest support ofsociety, and the only principle which ought never to be a moment absentfrom our thoughts and meditations? But, in treating of this obvious andimportant truth, what obscure questions occur concerning the nature ofthat Divine Being, his attributes, his decrees, his plan of providence?These have been always subjected to the disputations of men; concerningthese human reason has not reached any certain determination. But theseare topics so interesting, that we cannot restrain our restless inquirywith regard to them; though nothing but doubt, uncertainty, andcontradiction, have as yet been the result of our most accurateresearches.This I had lately occasion to observe, while I passed, as usual, part ofthe summer season with CLEANTHES, and was present at those conversationsof his with PHILO and DEMEA, of which I gave you lately some imperfectaccount. Your curiosity, you then told me, was so excited, that I must,of necessity, enter into a more exact detail of their reasonings, anddisplay those various systems which they advanced with regard to sodelicate a subject as that of natural religion. The remarkable contrastin their characters still further raised your expectations; while youopposed the accurate philosophical turn of CLEANTHES to the carelessscepticism of PHILO, or compared either of their dispositions with therigid inflexible orthodoxy of DEMEA. My youth rendered me a mere auditorof their disputes; and that curiosity, natural to the early season oflife, has so deeply imprinted in my memory the whole chain and connectionof their arguments, that, I hope, I shall not omit or confound anyconsiderable part of them in the recital.PART 1After I joined the company, whom I found sitting in CLEANTHES's library,DEMEA paid CLEANTHES some compliments on the great care which he took ofmy education, and on his unwearied perseverance and constancy in all hisfriendships. The father of PAMPHILUS, said he, was your intimate friend:The son is your pupil; and may indeed be regarded as your adopted son,were we to judge by the pains which you bestow in conveying to him everyuseful branch of literature and science. You are no more wanting, I ampersuaded, in prudence, than in industry. I shall, therefore, communicateto you a maxim, which I have observed with regard to my own children,that I may learn how far it agrees with your practice. The method Ifollow in their education is founded on the saying of an ancient, "Thatstudents of philosophy ought first to learn logics, then ethics, nextphysics, last of all the nature of the gods." [Chrysippus apud Plut: derepug: Stoicorum] This science of natural theology, according to him,being the most profound and abstruse of any, required the maturestjudgement in its students; and none but a mind enriched with all the othersciences, can safely be entrusted with it.Are you so late, says PHILO, in teaching your children the principles ofreligion? Is there no danger of their neglecting, or rejecting altogetherthose opinions of which they have heard so little during the whole courseof their education? It is only as a science, replied DEMEA, subjected tohuman reasoning and disputation, that I postpone the study of NaturalTheology. To season their minds with early piety, is my chief care; andby continual precept and instruction, and I hope too by example, Iimprint deeply on their tender minds an habitual reverence for all theprinciples of religion. While they pass through every other science, Istill remark the uncertainty of each part; the eternal disputations ofmen; the obscurity of all philosophy; and the strange, ridiculousconclusions, which some of the greatest geniuses have derived from theprinciples of mere human reason. Having thus tamed their mind to a propersubmission and self-diffidence, I have no longer any scruple of openingto them the greatest mysteries of religion; nor apprehend any danger fromthat assuming arrogance of philosophy, which may lead them to reject themost established doctrines and opinions.Your precaution, says PHILO, of seasoning your children's minds earlywith piety, is certainly very reasonable; and no more than is requisitein this profane and irreligious age. But what I chiefly admire in yourplan of education, is your method of drawing advantage from the veryprinciples of philosophy and learning, which, by inspiring pride andself-sufficiency, have commonly, in all ages, been found so destructiveto the principles of religion. The vulgar, indeed, we may remark, who areunacquainted with science and profound inquiry, observing the endlessdisputes of the learned, have commonly a thorough contempt forphilosophy; and rivet themselves the faster, by that means, in the greatpoints of theology which have been taught them. Those who enter a littleinto study and inquiry, finding many appearances of evidence indoctrines the newest and most extraordinary, think nothing too difficultfor human reason; and, presumptuously breaking through all fences,profane the inmost
