Dialogues
Concerning
Natural
ReligionbyDavid
HumePAMPHILUS
TO
HERMIPPUSIt
has
been
remarked,
my
HERMIPPUS,
that
though
the
ancient
philosophersconveyed
most
of
their
instruction
in
the
form
of
dialogue,
this
methodof
composition
has
been
little
practised
in
later
ages,
and
has
seldomsucceeded
in
the
hands
of
those
who
have
attempted
it.
Accurate
andregular
argument,
indeed,
such
as
is
now
expected
of
philosophicalinquirers,
naturally
throws
a
man
into
the
methodical
and
didacticmanner;
where
he
can
immediately,
without
preparation,
explain
the
pointat
which
he
aims;
and
thence
proceed,
without
interruption,
to
deducethe
proofs
on
which
it
is
established.
To
deliver
a
SYSTEM
inconversation,
scarcely
appears
natural;
and
while
the
dialogue-writerdesires,
by
departing
from
the
direct
style
of
composition,
to
give
afreer
air
to
his
performance,
and
avoid
the
appearance
of
Author
andReader,
he
is
apt
to
run
into
a
worse
inconvenience,
and
convey
theimage
of
Pedagogue
and
Pupil.
Or,
if
he
carries
on
the
dispute
in
thenatural
spirit
of
good
company,
by
throwing
in
a
variety
of
topics,
andpreserving
a
proper
balance
among
the
speakers,
he
often
loses
so
muchtime
in
preparations
and
transitions,
that
the
reader
will
scarcelythink
himself
compensated,
by
all
the
graces
of
dialogue,
for
the
order,brevity,
and
precision,
which
are
sacrificed
to
them.There
are
some
subjects,
however,
to
which
dialogue-writing
is
peculiarlyadapted,
and
where
it
is
still
preferable
to
the
direct
and
simple
methodof
composition.Any
point
of
doctrine,
which
is
so
obvious
that
it
scarcely
admits
ofdispute,
but
at
the
same
time
so
important
that
it
cannot
be
too
ofteninculcated,
seems
to
require
some
such
method
of
handling
it;
where
thenovelty
of
the
manner
may
compensate
the
triteness
of
the
subject;
wherethe
vivacity
of
conversation
may
enforce
the
precept;
and
where
thevariety
of
lights,
presented
by
various
personages
and
characters,
mayappear
neither
tedious
nor
redundant.Any
question
of
philosophy,
on
the
other
hand,
which
is
so
OBSCURE
andUNCERTAIN,
that
human
reason
can
reach
no
fixed
determination
with
regardto
it;
if
it
should
be
treated
at
all,
seems
to
lead
us
naturally
intothe
style
of
dialogue
and
conversation.
Reasonable
men
may
be
allowed
todiffer,
where
no
one
can
reasonably
be
positive.
Opposite
sentiments,even
without
any
decision,
afford
an
agreeable
amusement;
and
if
thesubject
be
curious
and
interesting,
the
book
carries
us,
in
a
manner,into
company;
and
unites
the
two
greatest
and
purest
pleasures
of
humanlife,
study
and
society.Happily,
these
circumstances
are
all
to
be
found
in
the
subject
ofNATURAL
RELIGION.
What
truth
so
obvious,
so
certain,
as
the
being
of
aGod,
which
the
most
ignorant
ages
have
acknowledged,
for
which
the
mostrefined
geniuses
have
ambitiously
striven
to
produce
new
proofs
andarguments?
What
truth
so
important
as
this,
which
is
the
ground
of
allour
hopes,
the
surest
foundation
of
morality,
the
firmest
support
ofsociety,
and
the
only
principle
which
ought
never
to
be
a
moment
absentfrom
our
thoughts
and
meditations?
But,
in
treating
of
this
obvious
andimportant
truth,
what
obscure
questions
occur
concerning
the
nature
ofthat
Divine
Being,
his
attributes,
his
decrees,
his
plan
of
providence?These
have
been
always
subjected
to
the
disputations
of
men;
concerningthese
human
reason
has
not
reached
any
certain
determination.
But
theseare
topics
so
interesting,
that
we
cannot
restrain
our
restless
inquirywith
regard
to
them;
though
nothing
but
doubt,
uncertainty,
andcontradiction,
have
as
yet
been
the
result
of
our
most
accurateresearches.This
I
had
lately
occasion
to
observe,
while
I
passed,
as
usual,
part
ofthe
summer
season
with
CLEANTHES,
and
was
present
at
those
conversationsof
his
with
PHILO
and
DEMEA,
of
which
I
gave
you
lately
some
imperfectaccount.
Your
curiosity,
you
then
told
me,
was
so
excited,
that
I
must,of
necessity,
enter
into
a
more
exact
detail
of
their
reasonings,
anddisplay
those
various
systems
which
they
advanced
with
regard
to
sodelicate
a
subject
as
that
of
natural
religion.
The
remarkable
contrastin
their
characters
still
further
raised
your
expectations;
while
youopposed
the
accurate
philosophical
turn
of
CLEANTHES
to
the
carelessscepticism
of
PHILO,
or
compared
either
of
their
dispositions
with
therigid
inflexible
orthodoxy
of
DEMEA.
My
youth
rendered
me
a
mere
auditorof
their
disputes;
and
that
curiosity,
natural
to
the
early
season
oflife,
has
so
deeply
imprinted
in
my
memory
the
whole
chain
and
connectionof
their
arguments,
that,
I
hope,
I
shall
not
omit
or
confound
anyconsiderable
part
of
them
in
the
recital.PART
1After
I
joined
the
company,
whom
I
found
sitting
in
CLEANTHES's
library,DEMEA
paid
CLEANTHES
some
compliments
on
the
great
care
which
he
took
ofmy
education,
and
on
his
unwearied
perseverance
and
constancy
in
all
hisfriendships.
The
father
of
PAMPHILUS,
said
he,
was
your
intimate
friend:The
son
is
your
pupil;
and
may
indeed
be
regarded
as
your
adopted
son,were
we
to
judge
by
the
pains
which
you
bestow
in
conveying
to
him
everyuseful
branch
of
literature
and
science.
You
are
no
more
wanting,
I
ampersuaded,
in
prudence,
than
in
industry.
I
shall,
therefore,
communicateto
you
a
maxim,
which
I
have
observed
with
regard
to
my
own
children,that
I
may
learn
how
far
it
agrees
with
your
practice.
The
method
Ifollow
in
their
education
is
founded
on
the
saying
of
an
ancient,
"Thatstudents
of
philosophy
ought
first
to
learn
logics,
then
ethics,
nextphysics,
last
of
all
the
nature
of
the
gods."
[Chrysippus
apud
Plut:
derepug:
Stoicorum]
This
science
of
natural
theology,
according
to
him,being
the
most
profound
and
abstruse
of
any,
required
the
maturestjudgement
in
its
students;
and
none
but
a
mind
enriched
with
all
the
othersciences,
can
safely
be
entrusted
with
it.Are
you
so
late,
says
PHILO,
in
teaching
your
children
the
principles
ofreligion?
Is
there
no
danger
of
their
neglecting,
or
rejecting
altogetherthose
opinions
of
which
they
have
heard
so
little
during
the
whole
courseof
their
education?
It
is
only
as
a
science,
replied
DEMEA,
subjected
tohuman
reasoning
and
disputation,
that
I
postpone
the
study
of
NaturalTheology.
To
season
their
minds
with
early
piety,
is
my
chief
care;
andby
continual
precept
and
instruction,
and
I
hope
too
by
example,
Iimprint
deeply
on
their
tender
minds
an
habitual
reverence
for
all
theprinciples
of
religion.
While
they
pass
through
every
other
science,
Istill
remark
the
uncertainty
of
each
part;
the
eternal
disputations
ofmen;
the
obscurity
of
all
philosophy;
and
the
strange,
ridiculousconclusions,
which
some
of
the
greatest
geniuses
have
derived
from
theprinciples
of
mere
human
reason.
Having
thus
tamed
their
mind
to
a
propersubmission
and
self-diffidence,
I
have
no
longer
any
scruple
of
openingto
them
the
greatest
mysteries
of
religion;
nor
apprehend
any
danger
fromthat
assuming
arrogance
of
philosophy,
which
may
lead
them
to
reject
themost
established
doctrines
and
opinions.Your
precaution,
says
PHILO,
of
seasoning
your
children's
minds
earlywith
piety,
is
certainly
very
reasonable;
and
no
more
than
is
requisitein
this
profane
and
irreligious
age.
But
what
I
chiefly
admire
in
yourplan
of
education,
is
your
method
of
drawing
advantage
from
the
veryprinciples
of
philosophy
and
learning,
which,
by
inspiring
pride
andself-sufficiency,
have
commonly,
in
all
ages,
been
found
so
destructiveto
the
principles
of
religion.
The
vulgar,
indeed,
we
may
remark,
who
areunacquainted
with
science
and
profound
inquiry,
observing
the
endlessdisputes
of
the
learned,
have
commonly
a
thorough
contempt
forphilosophy;
and
rivet
themselves
the
faster,
by
that
means,
in
the
greatpoints
of
theology
which
have
been
taught
them.
Those
who
enter
a
littleinto
study
and
inquiry,
finding
many
appearances
of
evidence
indoctrines
the
newest
and
most
extraordinary,
think
nothing
too
difficultfor
human
reason;
and,
presumptuously
breaking
through
all
fences,profane
the
inmost
sanctuaries
of
the
temple.
But
CLEANTHES
will,
I
hope,agree
with
me,
that,
after
we
have
abandoned
ignorance,
the
surestremedy,
there
is
still
one
expedient
left
to
prevent
this
profaneliberty.
Let
DEMEA's
principles
be
improved
and
cultivated:
Let
us
becomethoroughly
sensible
of
the
weakness,
blindness,
and
narrow
limits
ofhuman
reason:
Let
us
duly
consider
its
uncertainty
and
endlesscontrarieties,
even
in
subjects
of
common
life
and
practice:
Let
theerrors
and
deceits
of
our
very
senses
be
set
before
us;
the
insuperabledifficulties
which
attend
first
principles
in
all
systems;
thecontradictions
which
adhere
to
the
very
ideas
of
matter,
cause
andeffect,
extension,
space,
time,
motion;
and
in
a
word,
quantity
of
allkinds,
the
object
of
the
only
science
that
can
fairly
pretend
to
anycertainty
or
evidence.
When
these
topics
are
displayed
in
their
fulllight,
as
they
are
by
some
philosophers
and
almost
all
divines;
who
canretain
such
confidence
in
this
frail
faculty
of
reason
as
to
pay
anyregard
to
its
determinations
in
points
so
sublime,
so
abstruse,
so
remotefrom
common
life
and
experience?
When
the
coherence
of
the
parts
of
astone,
or
even
that
composition
of
parts
which
renders
it
extended;
whenthese
familiar
objects,
I
say,
are
so
inexplicable,
and
containcircumstances
so
repugnant
and
contradictory;
with
what
assurance
can
wedecide
concerning
the
origin
of
worlds,
or
trace
their
history
frometernity
to
eternity?While
PHILO
pronounced
these
words,
I
could
observe
a
smile
in
thecountenance
both
of
DEMEA
and
CLEANTHES.
That
of
DEMEA
seemed
to
imply
anunreserved
satisfaction
in
the
doctrines
delivered:
But,
in
CLEANTHES'sfeatures,
I
could
distinguish
an
air
of
finesse;
as
if
he
perceived
someraillery
or
artificial
malice
in
the
reasonings
of
PHILO.You
propose
then,
PHILO,
said
CLEANTHES,
to
erect
religious
faith
onphilosophical
scepticism;
and
you
think,
that
if
certainty
or
evidence
beexpelled
from
every
other
subject
of
inquiry,
it
will
all
retire
to
thesetheological
doctrines,
and
there
acquire
a
superior
force
and
authority.Whether
your
scepticism
be
as
absolute
and
sincere
as
you
pretend,
weshall
learn
by
and
by,
when
the
company
breaks
up:
We
shall
then
see,whether
you
go
out
at
the
door
or
the
window;
and
whether
you
reallydoubt
if
your
body
has
gravity,
or
can
be
injured
by
its
fall;
accordingto
popular
opinion,
derived
from
our
fallacious
senses,
and
morefallacious
experience.
And
this
consideration,
DEMEA,
may,
I
think,fairly
serve
to
abate
our
ill-will
to
this
humorous
sect
of
the
sceptics.If
they
be
thoroughly
in
earnest,
they
will
not
long
trouble
the
worldwith
their
doubts,
cavils,
and
disputes:
If
they
be
only
in
jest,
theyare,
perhaps,
bad
raillers;
but
can
never
be
very
dangerous,
either
tothe
state,
to
philosophy,
or
to
religion.In
reality,
PHILO,
continued
he,
it
seems
certain,
that
though
a
man,
ina
flush
of
humour,
after
intense
reflection
on
the
many
contradictionsand
imperfections
of
human
reason,
may
entirely
renounce
all
belief
andopinion,
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
persevere
in
this
total
scepticism,or
make
it
appear
in
his
conduct
for
a
few
hours.
External
objects
pressin
upon
him;
passions
solicit
him;
his
philosophical
melancholydissipates;
and
even
the
utmost
violence
upon
his
own
temper
will
not
beable,
during
any
time,
to
preserve
the
poor
appearance
of
scepticism.
Andfor
what
reason
impose
on
himself
such
a
violence?
This
is
a
point
inwhich
it
will
be
impossible
for
him
ever
to
satisfy
himself,
consistentlywith
his
sceptical
principles.
So
that,
upon
the
whole,
nothing
could
bemore
ridiculous
than
the
principles
of
the
ancient
PYRRHONIANS;
if
inreality
they
endeavoured,
as
is
pretended,
to
extend,
throughout,
thesame
scepticism
which
they
had
learned
from
the
declamations
of
theirschools,
and
which
they
ought
to
have
confined
to
them.In
this
view,
there
appears
a
great
resemblance
between
the
sects
of
theSTOICS
and
PYRRHONIANS,
though
perpetual
antagonists;
and
both
of
themseem
founded
on
this
erroneous
maxim,
That
what
a
man
can
performsometimes,
and
in
some
dispositions,
he
can
perform
always,
and
in
everydisposition.
When
the
mind,
by
Stoical
reflections,
is
elevated
into
asublime
enthusiasm
of
virtue,
and
strongly
smit
with
any
species
ofhonour
or
public
good,
the
utmost
bodily
pain
and
sufferings
will
notprevail
over
such
a
high
sense
of
duty;
and
it
is
possible,
perhaps,
byits
means,
even
to
smile
and
exult
in
the
midst
of
tortures.
If
thissometimes
may
be
the
case
in
fact
and
reality,
much
more
may
aphilosopher,
in
his
school,
or
even
in
his
closet,
work
himself
up
tosuch
an
enthusiasm,
and
support
in
imagination
the
acutest
pain
or
mostcalamitous
event
which
he
can
possibly
conceive.
But
how
shall
he
supportthis
enthusiasm
itself?
The
bent
of
his
mind
relaxes,
and
cannot
berecalled
at
pleasure;
avocations
lead
him
astray;
misfortunes
attack
himunawares;
and
the
philosopher
sinks
by
degrees
into
the
plebeian.I
allow
of
your
comparison
between
the
STOICS
and
SKEPTICS,
repliedPHILO.
But
you
may
observe,
at
the
same
time,
that
though
the
mindcannot,
in
Stoicism,
support
the
highest
flights
of
philosophy,
yet,
evenwhen
it
sinks
lower,
it
still
retains
somewhat
of
its
former
disposition;and
the
effects
of
the
Stoic's
reasoning
will
appear
in
his
conduct
incommon
life,
and
through
the
whole
tenor
of
his
actions.
The
ancientschools,
particularly
that
of
ZENO,
produced
examples
of
virtue
andconstancy
which
seem
astonishing
to
present
times.
Vain
Wisdom
all
and
false
Philosophy.
Yet
with
a
pleasing
sorcery
could
charm
Pain,
for
a
while,
or
anguish;
and
excite
Fallacious
Hope,
or
arm
the
obdurate
breast
With
stubborn
Patience,
as
with
triple
steel.In
like
manner,
if
a
man
has
accustomed
himself
to
scepticalconsiderations
on
the
uncertainty
and
narrow
limits
of
reason,
he
willnot
entirely
forget
them
when
he
turns
his
reflection
on
other
subjects;but
in
all
his
philosophical
principles
and
reasoning,
I
dare
not
say
inhis
common
conduct,
he
will
be
found
different
from
those,
who
eithernever
formed
any
opinions
in
the
case,
or
have
entertained
sentimentsmore
favourable
to
human
reason.To
whatever
length
any
one
may
push
his
speculative
principles
ofscepticism,
he
must
act,
I
own,
and
live,
and
converse,
like
other
men;and
for
this
conduct
he
is
not
obliged
to
give
any
other
reason,
than
theabsolute
necessity
he
lies
under
of
so
doing.
If
he
ever
carries
hisspeculations
further
than
this
necessity
constrains
him,
andphilosophises
either
on
natural
or
moral
subjects,
he
is
allured
by
acertain
pleasure
and
satisfaction
which
he
finds
in
employing
himselfafter
that
manner.
He
considers
besides,
that
every
one,
even
in
commonlife,
is
constrained
to
have
more
or
less
of
this
philosophy;
that
fromour
earliest
infancy
we
make
continual
advances
in
forming
more
generalprinciples
of
conduct
and
reasoning;
that
the
larger
experience
weacquire,
and
the
stronger
reason
we
are
endued
with,
we
always
render
ourprinciples
the
more
general
and
comprehensive;
and
that
what
we
callphilosophy
is
nothing
but
a
more
regular
and
methodical
operation
of
thesame
kind.
To
philosophise
on
such
subjects,
is
nothing
essentiallydifferent
from
reasoning
on
common
life;
and
we
may
only
expect
greaterstability,
if
not
greater
truth,
from
our
philosophy,
on
account
of
itsexacter
and
more
scrupulous
method
of
proceeding.But
when
we
look
beyond
human
affairs
and
the
properties
of
thesurrounding
bodies:
when
we
carry
our
speculations
into
the
twoeternities,
before
and
after
the
present
state
of
things;
into
thecreation
and
formation
of
the
universe;
the
existence
and
properties
ofspirits;
the
powers
and
operations
of
one
universal
Spirit
existingwithout
beginning
and
without
end;
omnipotent,
omniscient,
immutable,infinite,
and
incomprehensible:
We
must
be
far
removed
from
the
smallesttendency
to
scepticism
not
to
be
apprehensive,
that
we
have
here
gotquite
beyond
the
reach
of
our
faculties.
So
long
as
we
confine
ourspeculations
to
trade,
or
morals,
or
politics,
or
criticism,
we
makeappeals,
every
moment,
to
common
sense
and
experience,
which
strengthenour
philosophical
conclusions,
and
remove,
at
least
in
part,
thesuspicion
which
we
so
justly
entertain
with
regard
to
every
reasoningthat
is
very
subtle
and
refined.
But,
in
theological
reasonings,
we
havenot
this
advantage;
while,
at
the
same
time,
we
are
employed
uponobjects,
which,
we
must
be
sensible,
are
too
large
for
our
grasp,
and
ofall
others,
require
most
to
be
familiarised
to
our
apprehension.
We
arelike
foreigners
in
a
strange
country,
to
whom
every
thing
must
seemsuspicious,
and
who
are
in
danger
every
moment
of
transgressing
againstthe
laws
and
customs
of
the
people
with
whom
they
live
and
converse.
Weknow
not
how
far
we
ought
to
trust
our
vulgar
methods
of
reasoning
insuch
a
subject;
since,
even
in
common
life,
and
in
that
province
which
ispeculiarly
appropriated
to
them,
we
cannot
account
for
them,
and
areentirely
guided
by
a
kind
of
instinct
or
necessity
in
employing
them.All
sceptics
pretend,
that,
if
reason
be
considered
in
an
abstract
view,it
furnishes
invincible
arguments
against
itself;
and
that
we
could
neverretain
any
conviction
or
assurance,
on
any
subject,
were
not
thesceptical
reasonings
so
refined
and
subtle,
that
they
are
not
able
tocounterpoise
the
more
solid
and
more
natural
arguments
derived
from
thesenses
and
experience.
But
it
is
evident,
whenever
our
arguments
losethis
advantage,
and
run
wide
of
common
life,
that
the
most
refinedscepticism
comes
to
be
upon
a
footing
with
them,
and
is
able
to
opposeand
counterbalance
them.
The
one
has
no
more
weight
than
the
other.
Themind
must
remain
in
suspense
between
them;
and
it
is
that
very
suspenseor
balance,
which
is
the
triumph
of
scepticism.But
I
observe,
says
CLEANTHES,
with
regard
to
you,
PHILO,
and
allspeculative
sceptics,
that
your
doctrine
and
practice
are
as
much
atvariance
in
the
most
abstruse
points
of
theory
as
in
the
conduct
ofcommon
life.
Wherever
evidence
discovers
itself,
you
adhere
to
it,notwithstanding
your
pretended
scepticism;
and
I
can
observe,
too,
someof
your
sect
to
be
as
decisive
as
those
who
make
greater
professions
ofcertainty
and
assurance.
In
reality,
would
not
a
man
be
ridiculous,
whopretended
to
reject
NEWTON's
explication
of
the
wonderful
phenomenon
ofthe
rainbow,
because
that
explication
gives
a
minute
anatomy
of
the
raysof
light;
a
subject,
forsooth,
too
refined
for
human
comprehension?
Andwhat
would
you
say
to
one,
who,
having
nothing
particular
to
object
tothe
arguments
of
COPERNICUS
and
GALILEO
for
the
motion
of
the
earth,should
withhold
his
assent,
on
that
general
principle,
that
thesesubjects
were
too
magnificent
and
remote
to
be
explained
by
the
narrowand
fallacious
reason
of
mankind?There
is
indeed
a
kind
of
brutish
and
ignorant
scepticism,
as
you
wellobserved,
which
gives
the
vulgar
a
general
prejudice
against
what
they
donot
easily
understand,
and
makes
them
reject
every
principle
whichrequires
elaborate
reasoning
to
prove
and
establish
it.
This
species
ofscepticism
is
fatal
to
knowledge,
not
to
religion;
since
we
find,
thatthose
who
make
greatest
profession
of
it,
give
often
their
assent,
notonly
to
the
great
truths
of
Theism
and
natural
theology,
but
even
to
themost
absurd
tenets
which
a
traditional
superstition
has
recommended
tothem.
They
firmly
believe
in
witches,
though
they
will
not
believe
norattend
to
the
most
simple
proposition
of
Euclid.
But
the
refined
andphilosophical
sceptics
fall
into
an
inconsistence
of
an
opposite
nature.They
push
their
researches
into
the
most
abstruse
corners
of
science;
andtheir
assent
attends
them
in
every
step,
proportioned
to
the
evidencewhich
they
meet
with.
They
are
even
obliged
to
acknowledge,
that
the
mostabstruse
and
remote
objects
are
those
which
are
best
explained
byphilosophy.
Light
is
in
reality
anatomised.
The
true
system
of
theheavenly
bodies
is
discovered
and
ascertained.
But
the
nourishment
ofbodies
by
food
is
still
an
inexplicable
mystery.
The
cohesion
of
theparts
of
matter
is
still
incomprehensible.
These
sceptics,
therefore,
areobliged,
in
every
question,
to
consider
each
particular
evidence
apart,and
proportion
their
assent
to
the
precise
degree
of
evidence
whichoccurs.
This
is
their
practice
in
all
natural,
mathematical,
moral,
andpolitical
science.
And
why
not
the
same,
I
ask,
in
the
theological
andreligious?
Why
must
conclusions
of
this
nature
be
alone
rejected
on
thegeneral
presumption
of
the
insufficiency
of
human
reason,
without
anyparticular
discussion
of
the
evidence?
Is
not
such
an
unequal
conduct
aplain
proof
of
prejudice
and
passion?Our
senses,
you
say,
are
fallacious;
our
understanding
erroneous;
ourideas,
even
of
the
most
familiar
objects,
extension,
duration,
motion,full
of
absurdities
and
contradictions.
You
defy
me
to
solve
thedifficulties,
or
reconcile
the
repugnancies
which
you
discover
in
them.
Ihave
not
capacity
for
so
great
an
undertaking:
I
have
not
leisure
for
it:I
perceive
it
to
be
superfluous.
Your
own
conduct,
in
every
circumstance,refutes
your
principles,
and
shows
the
firmest
reliance
on
all
thereceived
maxims
of
science,
morals,
prudence,
and
behaviour.I
shall
never
assent
to
so
harsh
an
opinion
as
that
of
a
celebratedwriter
[L'Arte
de
penser],
who
says,
that
the
Sceptics
are
not
a
sect
ofphilosophers:
They
are
only
a
sect
of
liars.
I
may,
however,
affirm(I
hope
without
offence),
that
they
are
a
sect
of
jesters
or
raillers.But
for
my
part,
whenever
I
find
myself
disposed
to
mirth
and
amusement,I
shall
certainly
choose
my
entertainment
of
a
less
perplexing
and
abstrusenature.
A
comedy,
a
novel,
or
at
most
a
history,
seems
a
more
naturalrecreation
than
such
metaphysical
subtleties
and
abstractions.In
vain
would
the
sceptic
make
a
distinction
between
science
and
commonlife,
or
between
one
science
and
another.
The
arguments
employed
in
all,if
just,
are
of
a
similar
nature,
and
contain
the
same
force
andevidence.
Or
if
there
be
any
difference
among
them,
the
advantage
liesentirely
on
the
side
of
theology
and
natural
religion.
Many
principles
ofmechanics
are
founded
on
very
abstruse
reasoning;
yet
no
man
who
has
anypretensions
to
science,
even
no
speculative
sceptic,
pretends
toentertain
the
least
doubt
with
regard
to
them.
The
COPERNICAN
systemcontains
the
most
surprising
paradox,
and
the
most
contrary
to
ournatural
conceptions,
to
appearances,
and
to
our
very
senses:
yet
evenmonks
and
inquisitors
are
now
constrained
to
withdraw
their
opposition
toit.
And
shall
PHILO,
a
man
of
so
liberal
a
genius
and
extensiveknowledge,
entertain
any
general
undistinguished
scruples
with
regard
tothe
religious
hypothesis,
which
is
founded
on
the
simplest
and
mostobvious
arguments,
and,
unless
it
meets
with
artificial
obstacles,
hassuch
easy
access
and
admission
into
the
mind
of
man?And
here
we
may
observe,
continued
he,
turning
himself
towards
DEMEA,
apretty
curious
circumstance
in
the
history
of
the
sciences.
After
theunion
of
philosophy
with
the
popular
religion,
upon
the
firstestablishment
of
Christianity,
nothing
was
more
usual,
among
allreligious
teachers,
than
declamations
against
reason,
against
the
senses,against
every
principle
derived
merely
from
human
research
and
inquiry.All
the
topics
of
the
ancient
academics
were
adopted
by
the
fathers;
andthence
propagated
for
several
ages
in
every
school
and
pulpit
throughoutChristendom.
The
Reformers
embraced
the
same
principles
of
reasoning,
orrather
declamation;
and
all
panegyrics
on
the
excellency
of
faith,
weresure
to
be
interlarded
with
some
severe
strokes
of
satire
against
naturalreason.
A
celebrated
prelate
[Monsr.
Huet]
too,
of
the
Romish
communion,a
man
of
the
most
extensive
learning,
who
wrote
a
demonstration
ofChristianity,
has
also
composed
a
treatise,
which
contains
all
the
cavilsof
the
boldest
and
most
determined
PYRRHONISM.
LOCKE
seems
to
have
been
thefirst
Christian
who
ventured
openly
to
assert,
that
faith
was
nothing
buta
species
of
reason;
that
religion
was
only
a
branch
of
philosophy;
andthat
a
chain
of
arguments,
similar
to
that
which
established
any
truth
inmorals,
politics,
or
physics,
was
always
employed
in
discovering
all
theprinciples
of
theology,
natural
and
revealed.
The
ill
use
which
BAYLE
andother
libertines
made
of
the
philosophical
scepticism
of
the
fathers
andfirst
reformers,
still
further
propagated
the
judicious
sentiment
of
Mr.LOCKE:
And
it
is
now
in
a
manner
avowed,
by
all
pretenders
to
reasoningand
philosophy,
that
Atheist
and
Sceptic
are
almost
synonymous.
And
as
itis
certain
that
no
man
is
in
earnest
when
he
professes
the
latterprinciple,
I
would
fain
hope
that
there
are
as
few
who
seriously
maintainthe
former.Don't
you
remember,
said
PHILO,
the
excellent
saying
of
LORD
BACON
onthis
head?
That
a
little
philosophy,
replied
CLEANTHES,
makes
a
man
anAtheist:
A
great
deal
converts
him
to
religion.
That
is
a
very
judiciousremark
too,
said
PHILO.
But
what
I
have
in
my
eye
is
another
passage,where,
having
mentioned
DAVID's
fool,
who
said
in
his
heart
there
is
noGod,
this
great
philosopher
observes,
that
the
Atheists
nowadays
have
adouble
share
of
folly;
for
they
are
not
contented
to
say
in
their
heartsthere
is
no
God,
but
they
also
utter
that
impiety
with
their
lips,
andare
thereby
guilty
of
multiplied
indiscretion
and
imprudence.
Suchpeople,
though
they
were
ever
so
much
in
earnest,
cannot,
methinks,
bevery
formidable.But
though
you
should
rank
me
in
this
class
of
fools,
I
cannot
forbearcommunicating
a
remark
that
occurs
to
me,
from
the
history
of
thereligious
and
irreligious
scepticism
with
which
you
have
entertained
us.It
appears
to
me,
that
there
are
strong
symptoms
of
priestcraft
in
thewhole
progress
of
this
affair.
During
ignorant
ages,
such
as
those
whichfollowed
the
dissolution
of
the
ancient
schools,
the
priests
perceived,that
Atheism,
Deism,
or
heresy
of
any
kind,
could
only
proceed
from
thepresumptuous
questioning
of
received
opinions,
and
from
a
belief
thathuman
reason
was
equal
to
every
thing.
Education
had
then
a
mightyinfluence
over
the
minds
of
men,
and
was
almost
equal
in
force
to
thosesuggestions
of
the
senses
and
common
understanding,
by
which
the
mostdetermined
sceptic
must
allow
himself
to
be
governed.
But
at
present,when
the
influence
of
education
is
much
diminished,
and
men,
from
a
moreopen
commerce
of
the
world,
have
learned
to
compare
the
popularprinciples
of
different
nations
and
ages,
our
sagacious
divines
havechanged
their
whole
system
of
philosophy,
and
talk
the
language
ofSTOICS,
PLATONISTS,
and
PERIPATETICS,
not
that
of
PYRRHONIANS
andACADEMICS.
If
we
distrust
human
reason,
we
have
now
no
other
principle
tolead
us
into
religion.
Thus,
sceptics
in
one
age,
dogmatists
in
another;whichever
system
best
suits
the
purpose
of
these
reverend
gentlemen,
ingiving
them
an
ascendant
over
mankind,
they
are
sure
to
make
it
theirfavourite
principle,
and
established
tenet.It
is
very
natural,
said
CLEANTHES,
for
men
to
embrace
those
principles,by
which
they
find
they
can
best
defend
their
doctrines;
nor
need
we
haveany
recourse
to
priestcraft
to
account
for
so
reasonable
an
expedient.And,
surely
nothing
can
afford
a
stronger
presumption,
that
any
set
ofprinciples
are
true,
and
ought
to
be
embraced,
than
to
observe
that
theytend
to
the
confirmation
of
true
religion,
and
serve
to
confound
thecavils
of
Atheists,
Libertines,
and
Freethinkers
of
all
denominations.PART
2I
must
own,
CLEANTHES,
said
DEMEA,
that
nothing
can
more
surprise
me,than
the
light
in
which
you
have
all
along
put
this
argument.
By
thewhole
tenor
of
your
discourse,
one
would
imagine
that
you
weremaintaining
the
Being
of
a
God,
against
the
cavils
of
Atheists
andInfidels;
and
were
necessitated
to
become
a
champion
for
that
fundamentalprinciple
of
all
religion.
But
this,
I
hope,
is
not
by
any
means
aquestion
among
us.
No
man,
no
man
at
least
of
common
sense,
I
ampersuaded,
ever
entertained
a
serious
doubt
with
regard
to
a
truth
socertain
and
self-evident.
The
question
is
not
concerning
the
being,
butthe
nature
of
God.
This,
I
affirm,
from
the
infirmities
of
humanunderstanding,
to
be
altogether
incomprehensible
and
unknown
to
us.
Theessence
of
that
supreme
Mind,
his
attributes,
the
manner
of
hisexistence,
the
very
nature
of
his
duration;
these,
and
every
particularwhich
regards
so
divine
a
Being,
are
mysterious
to
men.
Finite,
weak,
andblind
creatures,
we
ought
to
humble
ourselves
in
his
august
presence;and,
conscious
of
our
frailties,
adore
in
silence
his
infiniteperfections,
which
eye
hath
not
seen,
ear
hath
not
heard,
neither
hath
itentered
into
the
heart
of
man
to
conceive.
They
are
covered
in
a
deepcloud
from
human
curiosity.
It
is
profaneness
to
attempt
penetratingthrough
these
sacred
obscurities.
And,
next
to
the
impiety
of
denying
hisexistence,
is
the
temerity
of
prying
into
his
nature
and
essence,
decreesand
attributes.But
lest
you
should
think
that
my
piety
has
here
got
the
better
of
myphilosophy,
I
shall
support
my
opinion,
if
it
needs
any
support,
by
a
verygreat
authority.
I
might
cite
all
the
divines,
almost,
from
the
foundationof
Christianity,
who
have
ever
treated
of
this
or
any
other
theologicalsubject:
But
I
shall
confine
myself,
at
present,
to
one
equally
celebratedfor
piety
and
philosophy.
It
is
Father
MALEBRANCHE,
who,
I
remember,
thusexpresses
himself
[Recherche
de
la
Verite.
Liv.
3.
Chap.9].
"One
ought
notso
much,"
says
he,
"to
call
God
a
spirit,
in
order
to
express
positivelywhat
he
is,
as
in
order
to
signify
that
he
is
not
matter.
He
is
a
Beinginfinitely
perfect:
Of
this
we
cannot
doubt.
But
in
the
same
manner
aswe
ought
not
to
imagine,
even
supposing
him
corporeal,
that
he
is
clothedwith
a
human
body,
as
the
ANTHROPOMORPHITES
asserted,
under
colour
thatthat
figure
was
the
most
perfect
of
any;
so,
neither
ought
we
to
imaginethat
the
spirit
of
God
has
human
ideas,
or
bears
any
resemblance
to
ourspirit,
under
colour
that
we
know
nothing
more
perfect
than
a
human
mind.We
ought
rather
to
believe,
that
as
he
comprehends
the
perfections
ofmatter
without
being
material....
he
comprehends
also
the
perfections
ofcreated
spirits
without
being
spirit,
in
the
manner
we
conceive
spirit:That
his
true
name
is,
He
that
is;
or,
in
other
words,
Being
withoutrestriction,
All
Being,
the
Being
infinite
and
universal."After
so
great
an
authority,
DEMEA,
replied
PHILO,
as
that
which
you
haveproduced,
and
a
thousand
more
which
you
might
produce,
it
would
appearridiculous
in
me
to
add
my
sentiment,
or
express
my
approbation
of
yourdoctrine.
But
surely,
where
reasonable
men
treat
these
subjects,
thequestion
can
never
be
concerning
the
Being,
but
only
the
Nature,
of
theDeity.
The
former
truth,
as
you
well
observe,
is
unquestionable
andself-evident.
Nothing
exists
without
a
cause;
and
the
original
cause
ofthis
universe
(whatever
it
be)
we
call
God;
and
piously
ascribe
to
himevery
species
of
perfection.
Whoever
scruples
this
fundamental
truth,deserves
every
punishment
which
can
be
inflicted
among
philosophers,
towit,
the
greatest
ridicule,
contempt,
and
disapprobation.
But
as
allperfection
is
entirely
relative,
we
ought
never
to
imagine
that
wecomprehend
the
attributes
of
this
divine
Being,
or
to
suppose
that
hisperfections
have
any
analogy
or
likeness
to
the
perfections
of
a
humancreature.
Wisdom,
Thought,
Design,
Knowledge;
these
we
justly
ascribe
tohim;
because
these
words
are
honourable
among
men,
and
we
have
no
otherlanguage
or
other
conceptions
by
which
we
can
express
our
adoration
ofhim.
But
let
us
beware,
lest
we
think
that
our
ideas
anywise
correspondto
his
perfections,
or
that
his
attributes
have
any
resemblance
to
thesequalities
among
men.
He
is
infinitely
superior
to
our
limited
view
andcomprehension;
and
is
more
the
object
of
worship
in
the
temple,
than
ofdisputation
in
the
schools.In
reality,
CLEANTHES,
continued
he,
there
is
no
need
of
having
recourseto
that
affected
scepticism
so
displeasing
to
you,
in
order
to
come
atthis
determination.
Our
ideas
reach
no
further
than
our
experience.
Wehave
no
experience
of
divine
attributes
and
operations.
I
need
notconclude
my
syllogism.
You
can
draw
the
inference
yourself.
And
it
is
apleasure
to
me
(and
I
hope
to
you
too)
that
just
reasoning
and
soundpiety
here
concur
in
the
same
conclusion,
and
both
of
them
establish
theadorably
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
nature
of
the
Supreme
Being.Not
to
lose
any
time
in
circumlocutions,
said
CLEANTHES,
addressinghimself
to
DEMEA,
much
less
in
replying
to
the
pious
declamations
ofPHILO;
I
shall
briefly
explain
how
I
conceive
this
matter.
Look
round
theworld:
contemplate
the
whole
and
every
part
of
it:
You
will
find
it
to
benothing
but
one
great
machine,
subdivided
into
an
infinite
number
oflesser
machines,
which
again
admit
of
subdivisions
to
a
degree
beyondwhat
human
senses
and
faculties
can
trace
and
explain.
All
these
variousmachines,
and
even
their
most
minute
parts,
are
adjusted
to
each
otherwith
an
accuracy
which
ravishes
into
admiration
all
men
who
have
evercontemplated
them.
The
curious
adapting
of
means
to
ends,
throughout
allnature,
resembles
exactly,
though
it
much
exceeds,
the
productions
ofhuman
contrivance;
of
human
designs,
thought,
wisdom,
and
intelligence.Since,
therefore,
the
effects
resemble
each
other,
we
are
led
to
infer,by
all
the
rules
of
analogy,
that
the
causes
also
resemble;
and
that
theAuthor
of
Nature
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
mind
of
man,
though
possessedof
much
larger
faculties,
proportioned
to
the
grandeur
of
the
work
whichhe
has
executed.
By
this
argument
a
posteriori,
and
by
this
argumentalone,
do
we
prove
at
once
the
existence
of
a
Deity,
and
his
similarityto
human
mind
and
intelligence.I
shall
be
so
free,
CLEANTHES,
said
DEMEA,
as
to
tell
you,
that
from
thebeginning,
I
could
not
approve
of
your
conclusion
concerning
thesimilarity
of
the
Deity
to
men;
still
less
can
I
approve
of
the
mediumsby
which
you
endeavour
to
establish
it.
What!
No
demonstration
of
theBeing
of
God!
No
abstract
arguments!
No
proofs
a
priori!
Are
these,
whichhave
hitherto
been
so
much
insisted
on
by
philosophers,
all
fallacy,
allsophism?
Can
we
reach
no
further
in
this
subject
than
experience
andprobability?
I
will
not
say
that
this
is
betraying
the
cause
of
a
Deity:But
surely,
by
this
affected
candour,
you
give
advantages
to
Atheists,which
they
never
could
obtain
by
the
mere
dint
of
argument
and
reasoning.What
I
chiefly
scruple
in
this
subject,
said
PHILO,
is
not
so
much
thatall
religious
arguments
are
by
CLEANTHES
reduced
to
experience,
as
thatthey
appear
not
to
be
even
the
most
certain
and
irrefragable
of
thatinferior
kind.
That
a
stone
will
fall,
that
fire
will
burn,
that
theearth
has
solidity,
we
have
observed
a
thousand
and
a
thousand
times;
andwhen
any
new
instance
of
this
nature
is
presented,
we
draw
withouthesitation
the
accustomed
inference.
The
exact
similarity
of
the
casesgives
us
a
perfect
assurance
of
a
similar
event;
and
a
stronger
evidenceis
never
desired
nor
sought
after.
But
wherever
you
depart,
in
the
least,from
the
similarity
of
the
cases,
you
diminish
proportionably
theevidence;
and
may
at
last
bring
it
to
a
very
weak
analogy,
which
isconfessedly
liable
to
error
and
uncertainty.
After
having
experienced
thecirculation
of
the
blood
in
human
creatures,
we
make
no
doubt
that
ittakes
place
in
TITIUS
and
MAEVIUS.
But
from
its
circulation
in
frogs
andfishes,
it
is
only
a
presumption,
though
a
strong
one,
from
analogy,
thatit
takes
place
in
men
and
other
animals.
The
analogical
reasoning
is
muchweaker,
when
we
infer
the
circulation
of
the
sap
in
vegetables
from
ourexperience
that
the
blood
circulates
in
animals;
and
those,
who
hastilyfollowed
that
imperfect
analogy,
are
found,
by
more
accurate
experiments,to
have
been
mistaken.If
we
see
a
house,
CLEANTHES,
we
conclude,
with
the
greatest
certainty,that
it
had
an
architect
or
builder;
because
this
is
precisely
thatspecies
of
effect
which
we
have
experienced
to
proceed
from
that
speciesof
cause.
But
surely
you
will
not
affirm,
that
the
universe
bears
such
aresemblance
to
a
house,
that
we
can
with
the
same
certainty
infer
asimilar
cause,
or
that
the
analogy
is
here
entire
and
perfect.
Thedissimilitude
is
so
striking,
that
the
utmost
you
can
here
pretend
to
isa
guess,
a
conjecture,
a
presumption
concerning
a
similar
cause;
and
howthat
pretension
will
be
received
in
the
world,
I
leave
you
to
consider.It
would
surely
be
very
ill
received,
replied
CLEANTHES;
and
I
should
bedeservedly
blamed
and
detested,
did
I
allow,
that
the
proofs
of
a
Deityamounted
to
no
more
than
a
guess
or
conjecture.
But
is
the
wholeadjustment
of
means
to
ends
in
a
house
and
in
the
universe
so
slight
aresemblance?
The
economy
of
final
causes?
The
order,
proportion,
andarrangement
of
every
part?
Steps
of
a
stair
are
plainly
contrived,
thathuman
legs
may
use
them
in
mounting;
and
this
inference
is
certain
andinfallible.
Human
legs
are
also
contrived
for
walking
and
mounting;
andthis
inference,
I
allow,
is
not
altogether
so
certain,
because
of
thedissimilarity
which
you
remark;
but
does
it,
therefore,
deserve
the
nameonly
of
presumption
or
conjecture?Good
God!
cried
DEMEA,
interrupting
him,
where
are
we?
Zealous
defendersof
religion
allow,
that
the
proofs
of
a
Deity
fall
short
of
perfectevidence!
And
you,
PHILO,
on
whose
assistance
I
depended
in
proving
theadorable
mysteriousness
of
the
Divine
Nature,
do
you
assent
to
all
theseextravagant
opinions
of
CLEANTHES?
For
what
other
name
can
I
give
them?or,
why
spare
my
censure,
when
such
principles
are
advanced,
supported
bysuch
an
authority,
before
so
young
a
man
as
PAMPHILUS?You
seem
not
to
apprehend,
replied
PHILO,
that
I
argue
with
CLEANTHES
inhis
own
way;
and,
by
showing
him
the
dangerous
consequences
of
histenets,
hope
at
last
to
reduce
him
to
our
opinion.
But
what
sticks
mostwith
you,
I
observe,
is
the
representation
which
CLEANTHES
has
made
ofthe
argument
a
posteriori;
and
finding
that
that
argument
is
likely
toescape
your
hold
and
vanish
into
air,
you
think
it
so
disguised,
that
youcan
scarcely
believe
it
to
be
set
in
its
true
light.
Now,
however
much
Imay
dissent,
in
other
respects,
from
the
dangerous
principles
ofCLEANTHES,
I
must
allow
that
he
has
fairly
represented
that
argument;
andI
shall
endeavour
so
to
state
the
matter
to
you,
that
you
will
entertainno
further
scruples
with
regard
to
it.Were
a
man
to
abstract
from
every
thing
which
he
knows
or
has
seen,
hewould
be
altogether
incapable,
merely
from
his
own
ideas,
to
determinewhat
kind
of
scene
the
universe
must
be,
or
to
give
the
preference
to
onestate
or
situation
of
things
above
another.
For
as
nothing
which
heclearly
conceives
could
be
esteemed
impossible
or
implying
a
contradiction,every
chimera
of
his
fancy
would
be
upon
an
equal
footing;
nor
could
heassign
any
just
reason
why
he
adheres
to
one
idea
or
system,
and
rejectsthe
others
which
are
equally
possible.Again;
after
he
opens
his
eyes,
and
contemplates
the
world
as
it
reallyis,
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
at
first
to
assign
the
cause
of
anyone
event,
much
less
of
the
whole
of
things,
or
of
the
universe.
He
mightset
his
fancy
a
rambling;
and
she
might
bring
him
in
an
infinite
varietyof
reports
and
representations.
These
would
all
be
possible;
but
beingall
equally
possible,
he
would
never
of
himself
give
a
satisfactoryaccount
for
his
preferring
one
of
them
to
the
rest.
Experience
alone
canpoint
out
to
him
the
true
cause
of
any
phenomenon.Now,
according
to
this
method
of
reasoning,
DEMEA,
it
follows,
(and
is,indeed,
tacitly
allowed
by
CLEANTHES
himself,)
that
order,
arrangement,or
the
adjustment
of
final
causes,
is
not
of
itself
any
proof
of
design;but
only
so
far
as
it
has
been
experienced
to
proceed
from
thatprinciple.
For
aught
we
can
know
a
priori,
matter
may
contain
the
sourceor
spring
of
order
originally
within
itself,
as
well
as
mind
does;
andthere
is
no
more
difficulty
in
conceiving,
that
the
several
elements,from
an
internal
unknown
cause,
may
fall
into
the
most
exquisitearrangement,
than
to
conceive
that
their
ideas,
in
the
great
universalmind,
from
a
like
internal
unknown
cause,
fall
into
that
arrangement.
Theequal
possibility
of
both
these
suppositions
is
allowed.
But,
byexperience,
we
find,
(according
to
CLEANTHES),
that
there
is
a
differencebetween
them.
Throw
several
pieces
of
steel
together,
without
shape
orform;
they
will
never
arrange
themselves
so
as
to
compose
a
watch.
Stone,and
mortar,
and
wood,
without
an
architect,
never
erect
a
house.
But
theideas
in
a
human
mind,
we
see,
by
an
unknown,
inexplicable
economy,arrange
themselves
so
as
to
form
the
plan
of
a
watch
or
house.Experience,
therefore,
proves,
that
there
is
an
original
principle
oforder
in
mind,
not
in
matter.
From
similar
effects
we
infer
similarcauses.
The
adjustment
of
means
to
ends
is
alike
in
the
universe,
as
in
amachine
of
human
contrivance.
The
causes,
therefore,
must
be
resembling.I
was
from
the
beginning
scandalised,
I
must
own,
with
this
resemblance,which
is
asserted,
between
the
Deity
and
human
creatures;
and
mustconceive
it
to
imply
such
a
degradation
of
the
Supreme
Being
as
no
soundTheist
could
endure.
With
your
assistance,
therefore,
DEMEA,
I
shallendeavour
to
defend
what
you
justly
call
the
adorable
mysteriousness
ofthe
Divine
Nature,
and
shall
refute
this
reasoning
of
CLEANTHES,
providedhe
allows
that
I
have
made
a
fair
representation
of
it.When
CLEANTHES
had
assented,
PHILO,
after
a
short
pause,
proceeded
in
thefollowing
manner.That
all
inferences,
CLEANTHES,
concerning
fact,
are
founded
onexperience;
and
that
all
experimental
reasonings
are
founded
on
thesupposition
that
similar
causes
prove
similar
effects,
and
similareffects
similar
causes;
I
shall
not
at
present
much
dispute
with
you.
Butobserve,
I
entreat
you,
with
what
extreme
caution
all
just
reasonersproceed
in
the
transferring
of
experiments
to
similar
cases.
Unless
thecases
be
exactly
similar,
they
repose
no
perfect
confidence
in
applyingtheir
past
observation
to
any
particular
phenomenon.
Every
alteration
ofcircumstances
occasions
a
doubt
concerning
the
event;
and
it
requires
newexperiments
to
prove
certainly,
that
the
new
circumstances
are
of
nomoment
or
importance.
A
change
in
bulk,
situation,
arrangement,
age,disposition
of
the
air,
or
surrounding
bodies;
any
of
these
particularsmay
be
attended
with
the
most
unexpected
consequences:
And
unless
theobjects
be
quite
familiar
to
us,
it
is
the
highest
temerity
to
expectwith
assurance,
after
any
of
these
changes,
an
event
similar
to
thatwhich
before
fell
under
our
observation.
The
slow
and
deliberate
steps
ofphilosophers
here,
if
any
where,
are
distinguished
from
the
precipitatemarch
of
the
vulgar,
who,
hurried
on
by
the
smallest
similitude,
areincapable
of
all
discernment
or
consideration.But
can
you
think,
CLEANTHES,
that
your
usual
phlegm
and
philosophy
havebeen
preserved
in
so
wide
a
step
as
you
have
taken,
when
you
compared
tothe
universe
houses,
ships,
furniture,
machines,
and,
from
theirsimilarity
in
some
circumstances,
inferred
a
similarity
in
their
causes?Thought,
design,
intelligence,
such
as
we
discover
in
men
and
otheranimals,
is
no
more
than
one
of
the
springs
and
principles
of
theuniverse,
as
well
as
heat
or
cold,
attraction
or
repulsion,
and
a
hundredothers,
which
fall
under
daily
observation.
It
is
an
active
cause,
bywhich
some
particular
parts
of
nature,
we
find,
produce
alterations
onother
parts.
But
can
a
conclusion,
with
any
propriety,
be
transferredfrom
parts
to
the
whole?
Does
not
the
great
disproportion
bar
allcomparison
and
inference?
From
observing
the
growth
of
a
hair,
can
welearn
any
thing
concerning
the
generation
of
a
man?
Would
the
manner
of
aleaf's
blowing,
even
though
perfectly
known,
afford
us
any
instructionconcerning
the
vegetation
of
a
tree?But,
allowing
that
we
were
to
take
the
operations
of
one
part
of
natureupon
another,
for
the
foundation
of
our
judgement
concerning
the
originof
the
whole,
(which
never
can
be
admitted,)
yet
why
select
so
minute,
soweak,
so
bounded
a
principle,
as
the
reason
and
design
of
animals
isfound
to
be
upon
this
planet?
What
peculiar
privilege
has
this
littleagitation
of
the
brain
which
we
call
thought,
that
we
must
thus
make
itthe
model
of
the
whole
universe?
Our
partiality
in
our
own
favour
doesindeed
present
it
on
all
occasions;
but
sound
philosophy
ought
carefullyto
guard
against
so
natural
an
illusion.So
far
from
admitting,
continued
PHILO,
that
the
operations
of
a
part
canafford
us
any
just
conclusion
concerning
the
origin
of
the
whole,
I
willnot
allow
any
one
part
to
form
a
rule
for
another
part,
if
the
latter
bevery
remote
from
the
former.
Is
there
any
reasonable
ground
to
conclude,that
the
inhabitants
of
other
planets
possess
thought,
intelligence,reason,
or
any
thing
similar
to
these
faculties
in
men?
When
nature
hasso
extremely
diversified
her
manner
of
operation
in
this
small
globe,
canwe
imagine
that
she
incessantly
copies
herself
throughout
so
immense
auniverse?
And
if
thought,
as
we
may
well
suppose,
be
confined
merely
tothis
narrow
corner,
and
has
even
there
so
limited
a
sphere
of
action,with
what
propriety
can
we
assign
it
for
the
original
cause
of
allthings?
The
narrow
views
of
a
peasant,
who
makes
his
domestic
economy
therule
for
the
government
of
kingdoms,
is
in
comparison
a
pardonablesophism.But
were
we
ever
so
much
assured,
that
a
thought
and
reason,
resemblingthe
human,
were
to
be
found
throughout
the
whole
universe,
and
were
itsactivity
elsewhere
vastly
greater
and
more
commanding
than
it
appears
inthis
globe;
yet
I
cannot
see,
why
the
operations
of
a
world
constituted,arranged,
adjusted,
can
with
any
propriety
be
extended
to
a
world
whichis
in
its
embryo
state,
and
is
advancing
towards
that
constitution
andarrangement.
By
observation,
we
know
somewhat
of
the
economy,
action,
andnourishment
of
a
finished
animal;
but
we
must
transfer
with
great
cautionthat
observation
to
the
growth
of
a
foetus
in
the
womb,
and
still
more
tothe
formation
of
an
animalcule
in
the
loins
of
its
male
parent.
Nature,we
find,
even
from
our
limited
experience,
possesses
an
infinite
numberof
springs
and
principles,
which
incessantly
discover
themselves
on
everychange
of
her
position
and
situation.
And
what
new
and
unknown
principleswould
actuate
her
in
so
new
and
unknown
a
situation
as
that
of
theformation
of
a
universe,
we
cannot,
without
the
utmost
temerity,
pretendto
determine.A
very
small
part
of
this
great
system,
during
a
very
short
time,
is
veryimperfectly
discovered
to
us;
and
do
we
thence
pronounce
decisivelyconcerning
the
origin
of
the
whole?Admirable
conclusion!
Stone,
wood,
brick,
iron,
brass,
have
not,
at
thistime,
in
this
minute
globe
of
earth,
an
order
or
arrangement
withouthuman
art
and
contrivance;
therefore
the
universe
could
not
originallyattain
its
order
and
arrangement,
without
something
similar
to
human
art.But
is
a
part
of
nature
a
rule
for
another
part
very
wide
of
the
former?Is
it
a
rule
for
the
whole?
Is
a
very
small
part
a
rule
for
the
universe?Is
nature
in
one
situation,
a
certain
rule
for
nature
in
anothersituation
vastly
different
from
the
former?And
can
you
blame
me,
CLEANTHES,
if
I
here
imitate
the
prudent
reserve
ofSIMONIDES,
who,
according
to
the
noted
story,
being
asked
by
HIERO,What
God
was?
desired
a
day
to
think
of
it,
and
then
two
days
more;
andafter
that
manner
continually
prolonged
the
term,
without
ever
bringingin
his
definition
or
description?
Could
you
even
blame
me,
if
I
hadanswered
at
first,
that
I
did
not
know,
and
was
sensible
that
thissubject
lay
vastly
beyond
the
reach
of
my
faculties?
You
might
cry
outsceptic
and
railler,
as
much
as
you
pleased:
but
having
found,
in
so
manyother
subjects
much
more
familiar,
the
imperfections
and
evencontradictions
of
human
reason,
I
never
should
expect
any
success
fromits
feeble
conjectures,
in
a
subject
so
sublime,
and
so
remote
from
thesphere
of
our
observation.
When
two
species
of
objects
have
always
beenobserved
to
be
conjoined
together,
I
can
infer,
by
custom,
the
existenceof
one
wherever
I
see
the
existence
of
the
other;
and
this
I
call
anargument
from
experience.
But
how
this
argument
can
have
place,
where
theobjects,
as
in
the
present
case,
are
single,
individual,
withoutparallel,
or
specific
resemblance,
may
be
difficult
to
explain.
And
willany
man
tell
me
with
a
serious
countenance,
that
an
orderly
universe
mustarise
from
some
thought
and
art
like
the
human,
because
we
haveexperience
of
it?
To
ascertain
this
reasoning,
it
were
requisite
that
wehad
experience
of
the
origin
of
worlds;
and
it
is
not
sufficient,
surely,that
we
have
seen
ships
and
cities
arise
from
human
art
and
contrivance...PHILO
was
proceeding
in
this
vehement
manner,
somewhat
between
jest
andearnest,
as
it
appeared
to
me,
when
he
observed
some
signs
of
impatiencein
CLEANTHES,
and
then
immediately
stopped
short.
What
I
had
to
suggest,said
CLEANTHES,
is
only
that
you
would
not
abuse
terms,
or
make
use
ofpopular
expressions
to
subvert
philosophical
reasonings.
You
know,
thatthe
vulgar
often
distinguish
reason
from
experience,
even
where
thequestion
relates
only
to
matter
of
fact
and
existence;
though
it
isfound,
where
that
reason
is
properly
analysed,
that
it
is
nothing
but
aspecies
of
experience.
To
prove
by
experience
the
origin
of
the
universefrom
mind,
is
not
more
contrary
to
common
speech,
than
to
prove
themotion
of
the
earth
from
the
same
principle.
And
a
caviller
might
raiseall
the
same
objections
to
the
Copernican
system,
which
you
have
urgedagainst
my
reasonings.
Have
you
other
earths,
might
he
say,
which
youhave
seen
to
move?
Have...Yes!
cried
PHILO,
interrupting
him,
we
have
other
earths.
Is
not
the
moonanother
earth,
which
we
see
to
turn
round
its
centre?
Is
not
Venusanother
earth,
where
we
observe
the
same
phenomenon?
Are
not
therevolutions
of
the
sun
also
a
confirmation,
from
analogy,
of
the
sametheory?
All
the
planets,
are
they
not
earths,
which
revolve
about
thesun?
Are
not
the
satellites
moons,
which
move
round
Jupiter
and
Saturn,and
along
with
these
primary
planets
round
the
sun?
These
analogies
andresemblances,
with
others
which
I
have
not
mentioned,
are
the
sole
proofsof
the
COPERNICAN
system;
and
to
you
it
belongs
to
consider,
whether
youhave
any
analogies
of
the
same
kind
to
support
your
theory.In
reality,
CLEANTHES,
continued
he,
the
modern
system
of
astronomy
isnow
so
much
received
by
all
inquirers,
and
has
become
so
essential
a
parteven
of
our
earliest
education,
that
we
are
not
commonly
very
scrupulousin
examining
the
reasons
upon
which
it
is
founded.
It
is
now
become
amatter
of
mere
curiosity
to
study
the
first
writers
on
that
subject,
whohad
the
full
force
of
prejudice
to
encounter,
and
were
obliged
to
turntheir
arguments
on
every
side
in
order
to
render
them
popular
andconvincing.
But
if
we
peruse
GALILEO's
famous
Dialogues
concerning
thesystem
of
the
world,
we
shall
find,
that
that
great
genius,
one
of
thesublimest
that
ever
existed,
first
bent
all
his
endeavours
to
prove,
thatthere
was
no
foundation
for
the
distinction
commonly
made
betweenelementary
and
celestial
substances.
The
schools,
proceeding
from
theillusions
of
sense,
had
carried
this
distinction
very
far;
and
hadestablished
the
latter
substances
to
be
ingenerable,
incorruptible,unalterable,
impassable;
and
had
assigned
all
the
opposite
qualities
tothe
former.
But
GALILEO,
beginning
with
the
moon,
proved
its
similarityin
every
particular
to
the
earth;
its
convex
figure,
its
natural
darknesswhen
not
illuminated,
its
density,
its
distinction
into
solid
and
liquid,the
variations
of
its
phases,
the
mutual
illuminations
of
the
earth
andmoon,
their
mutual
eclipses,
the
inequalities
of
the
lunar
surface,
&c.After
many
instances
of
this
kind,
with
regard
to
all
the
planets,
menplainly
saw
that
these
bodies
became
proper
objects
of
experience;
andthat
the
similarity
of
their
nature
enabled
us
to
extend
the
samearguments
and
phenomena
from
one
to
the
other.In
this
cautious
proceeding
of
the
astronomers,
you
may
read
your
owncondemnation,
CLEANTHES;
or
rather
may
see,
that
the
subject
in
which
youare
engaged
exceeds
all
human
reason
and
inquiry.
Can
you
pretend
to
showany
such
similarity
between
the
fabric
of
a
house,
and
the
generation
ofa
universe?
Have
you
ever
seen
nature
in
any
such
situation
as
resemblesthe
first
arrangement
of
the
elements?
Have
worlds
ever
been
formed
underyour
eye;
and
have
you
had
leisure
to
observe
the
whole
progress
of
thephenomenon,
from
the
first
appearance
of
order
to
its
final
consummation?If
you
have,
then
cite
your
experience,
and
deliver
your
theory.PART
3How
the
most
absurd
argument,
replied
CLEANTHES,
in
the
hands
of
a
man
ofingenuity
and
invention,
may
acquire
an
air
of
probability!
Are
you
notaware,
PHILO,
that
it
became
necessary
for
Copernicus
and
his
firstdisciples
to
prove
the
similarity
of
the
terrestrial
and
celestialmatter;
because
several
philosophers,
blinded
by
old
systems,
andsupported
by
some
sensible
appearances,
had
denied
this
similarity?
butthat
it
is
by
no
means
necessary,
that
Theists
should
prove
thesimilarity
of
the
works
of
Nature
to
those
of
Art;
because
thissimilarity
is
self-evident
and
undeniable?
The
same
matter,
a
like
form;what
more
is
requisite
to
show
an
analogy
between
their
causes,
and
toascertain
the
origin
of
all
things
from
a
divine
purpose
and
intention?Your
objections,
I
must
freely
tell
you,
are
no
better
than
the
abstrusecavils
of
those
philosophers
who
denied
motion;
and
ought
to
be
refutedin
the
same
manner,
by
illustrations,
examples,
and
instances,
ratherthan
by
serious
argument
and
philosophy.Suppose,
therefore,
that
an
articulate
voice
were
heard
in
the
clouds,much
louder
and
more
melodious
than
any
which
human
art
could
ever
reach:Suppose,
that
this
voice
were
extended
in
the
same
instant
over
allnations,
and
spoke
to
each
nation
in
its
own
language
and
dialect:Suppose,
that
the
words
delivered
not
only
contain
a
just
sense
andmeaning,
but
convey
some
instruction
altogether
worthy
of
a
benevolentBeing,
superior
to
mankind:
Could
you
possibly
hesitate
a
momentconcerning
the
cause
of
this
voice?
and
must
you
not
instantly
ascribe
itto
some
design
or
purpose?
Yet
I
cannot
see
but
all
the
same
objections(if
they
merit
that
appellation)
which
lie
against
the
system
of
Theism,may
also
be
produced
against
this
inference.Might
you
not
say,
that
all
conclusions
concerning
fact
were
founded
onexperience:
that
when
we
hear
an
articulate
voice
in
the
dark,
and
thenceinfer
a
man,
it
is
only
the
resemblance
of
the
effects
which
leads
us
toconclude
that
there
is
a
like
resemblance
in
the
cause:
but
that
thisextraordinary
voice,
by
its
loudness,
extent,
and
flexibility
to
alllanguages,
bears
so
little
analogy
to
any
human
voice,
that
we
have
noreason
to
suppose
any
analogy
in
their
causes:
and
consequently,
that
arational,
wise,
coherent
speech
proceeded,
you
know
not
whence,
from
someaccidental
whistling
of
the
winds,
not
from
any
divine
reason
orintelligence?
You
see
clearly
your
own
objections
in
these
cavils,
and
Ihope
too
you
see
clearly,
that
they
cannot
possibly
have
more
force
inthe
one
case
than
in
the
other.But
to
bring
the
case
still
nearer
the
present
one
of
the
universe,
Ishall
make
two
suppositions,
which
imply
not
any
absurdity
orimpossibility.
Suppose
that
there
is
a
natural,
universal,
invariablelanguage,
common
to
every
individual
of
human
race;
and
that
books
arenatural
productions,
which
perpetuate
themselves
in
the
same
manner
withanimals
and
vegetables,
by
descent
and
propagation.
Several
expressionsof
our
passions
contain
a
universal
language:
all
brute
animals
have
anatural
speech,
which,
however
limited,
is
very
intelligible
to
their
ownspecies.
And
as
there
are
infinitely
fewer
parts
and
less
contrivance
inthe
finest
composition
of
eloquence,
than
in
the
coarsest
organised
body,the
propagation
of
an
Iliad
or
Aeneid
is
an
easier
supposition
than
thatof
any
plant
or
animal.Suppose,
therefore,
that
you
enter
into
your
library,
thus
peopled
bynatural
volumes,
containing
the
most
refined
reason
and
most
exquisitebeauty;
could
you
possibly
open
one
of
them,
and
doubt,
that
its
originalcause
bore
the
strongest
analogy
to
mind
and
intelligence?
When
itreasons
and
discourses;
when
it
expostulates,
argues,
and
enforces
itsviews
and
topics;
when
it
applies
sometimes
to
the
pure
intellect,sometimes
to
the
affections;
when
it
collects,
disposes,
and
adorns
everyconsideration
suited
to
the
subject;
could
you
persist
in
asserting,
thatall
this,
at
the
bottom,
had
really
no
meaning;
and
that
the
firstformation
of
this
volume
in
the
loins
of
its
original
parent
proceedednot
from
thought
and
design?
Your
obstinacy,
I
know,
reaches
not
thatdegree
of
firmness:
even
your
sceptical
play
and
wantonness
would
beabashed
at
so
glaring
an
absurdity.But
if
there
be
any
difference,
PHILO,
between
this
supposed
case
and
thereal
one
of
the
universe,
it
is
all
to
the
advantage
of
the
latter.
Theanatomy
of
an
animal
affords
many
stronger
instances
of
design
than
theperusal
of
LIVY
or
TACITUS;
and
any
objection
which
you
start
in
theformer
case,
by
carrying
me
back
to
so
unusual
and
extraordinary
a
sceneas
the
first
formation
of
worlds,
the
same
objection
has
place
on
thesupposition
of
our
vegetating
library.
Choose,
then,
your
party,
PHILO,without
ambiguity
or
evasion;
assert
either
that
a
rational
volume
is
noproof
of
a
rational
cause,
or
admit
of
a
similar
cause
to
all
the
worksof
nature.Let
me
here
observe
too,
continued
CLEANTHES,
that
this
religiousargument,
instead
of
being
weakened
by
that
scepticism
so
much
affectedby
you,
rather
acquires
force
from
it,
and
becomes
more
firm
andundisputed.
To
exclude
all
argument
or
reasoning
of
every
kind,
is
eitheraffectation
or
madness.
The
declared
profession
of
every
reasonablesceptic
is
only
to
reject
abstruse,
remote,
and
refined
arguments;
toadhere
to
common
sense
and
the
plain
instincts
of
nature;
and
to
assent,wherever
any
reasons
strike
him
with
so
full
a
force
that
he
cannot,without
the
greatest
violence,
prevent
it.
Now
the
arguments
for
NaturalReligion
are
plainly
of
this
kind;
and
nothing
but
the
most
perverse,obstinate
metaphysics
can
reject
them.
Consider,
anatomise
the
eye;survey
its
structure
and
contrivance;
and
tell
me,
from
your
own
feeling,if
the
idea
of
a
contriver
does
not
immediately
flow
in
upon
you
with
aforce
like
that
of
sensation.
The
most
obvious
conclusion,
surely,
is
infavour
of
design;
and
it
requires
time,
reflection,
and
study,
to
summonup
those
frivolous,
though
abstruse
objections,
which
can
supportInfidelity.
Who
can
behold
the
male
and
female
of
each
species,
thecorrespondence
of
their
parts
and
instincts,
their
passions,
and
wholecourse
of
life
before
and
after
generation,
but
must
be
sensible,
thatthe
propagation
of
the
species
is
intended
by
Nature?
Millions
andmillions
of
such
instances
present
themselves
through
every
part
of
theuniverse;
and
no
language
can
convey
a
more
intelligible
irresistiblemeaning,
than
the
curious
adjustment
of
final
causes.
To
what
degree,therefore,
of
blind
dogmatism
must
one
have
attained,
to
reject
suchnatural
and
such
convincing
arguments?Some
beauties
in
writing
we
may
meet
with,
which
seem
contrary
to
rules,and
which
gain
the
affections,
and
animate
the
imagination,
in
oppositionto
all
the
precepts
of
criticism,
and
to
the
authority
of
the
establishedmasters
of
art.
And
if
the
argument
for
Theism
be,
as
you
pretend,contradictory
to
the
principles
of
logic;
its
universal,
its
irresistibleinfluence
proves
clearly,
that
there
may
be
arguments
of
a
like
irregularnature.
Whatever
cavils
may
be
urged,
an
orderly
world,
as
well
as
acoherent,
articulate
speech,
will
still
be
received
as
an
incontestableproof
of
design
and
intention.It
sometimes
happens,
I
own,
that
the
religious
arguments
have
not
theirdue
influence
on
an
ignorant
savage
and
barbarian;
not
because
they
areobscure
and
difficult,
but
because
he
never
asks
himself
any
questionwith
regard
to
them.
Whence
arises
the
curious
structure
of
an
animal?From
the
copulation
of
its
parents.
And
these
whence?
From
their
parents?A
few
removes
set
the
objects
at
such
a
distance,
that
to
him
they
arelost
in
darkness
and
confusion;
nor
is
he
actuated
by
any
curiosity
totrace
them
further.
But
this
is
neither
dogmatism
nor
scepticism,
butstupidity:
a
state
of
mind
very
different
from
your
sifting,
inquisitivedisposition,
my
ingenious
friend.
You
can
trace
causes
from
effects:
Youcan
compare
the
most
distant
and
remote
objects:
and
your
greatest
errorsproceed
not
from
barrenness
of
thought
and
invention,
but
from
tooluxuriant
a
fertility,
which
suppresses
your
natural
good
sense,
by
aprofusion
of
unnecessary
scruples
and
objections.Here
I
could
observe,
HERMIPPUS,
that
PHILO
was
a
little
embarrassed
andconfounded:
But
while
he
hesitated
in
delivering
an
answer,
luckily
forhim,
DEMEA
broke
in
upon
the
discourse,
and
saved
his
countenance.Your
instance,
CLEANTHES,
said
he,
drawn
from
books
and
language,
beingfamiliar,
has,
I
confess,
so
much
more
force
on
that
account:
but
isthere
not
some
danger
too
in
this
very
circumstance;
and
may
it
notrender
us
presumptuous,
by
making
us
imagine
we
comprehend
the
Deity,
andhave
some
adequate
idea
of
his
nature
and
attributes?
When
I
read
avolume,
I
enter
into
the
mind
and
intention
of
the
author:
I
become
him,in
a
manner,
for
the
instant;
and
have
an
immediate
feeling
andconception
of
those
ideas
which
revolved
in
his
imagination
whileemployed
in
that
composition.
But
so
near
an
approach
we
never
surely
canmake
to
the
Deity.
His
ways
are
not
our
ways.
His
attributes
are
perfect,but
incomprehensible.
And
this
volume
of
nature
contains
a
great
andinexplicable
riddle,
more
than
any
intelligible
discourse
or
reasoning.The
ancient
PLATONISTS,
you
know,
were
the
most
religious
and
devout
ofall
the
Pagan
philosophers;
yet
many
of
them,
particularly
PLOTINUS,expressly
declare,
that
intellect
or
understanding
is
not
to
be
ascribedto
the
Deity;
and
that
our
most
perfect
worship
of
him
consists,
not
inacts
of
veneration,
reverence,
gratitude,
or
love;
but
in
a
certainmysterious
self-annihilation,
or
total
extinction
of
all
our
faculties.These
ideas
are,
perhaps,
too
far
stretched;
but
still
it
must
beacknowledged,
that,
by
representing
the
Deity
as
so
intelligible
andcomprehensible,
and
so
similar
to
a
human
mind,
we
are
guilty
of
thegrossest
and
most
narrow
partiality,
and
make
ourselves
the
model
of
thewhole
universe.All
the
sentiments
of
the
human
mind,
gratitude,
resentment,
love,friendship,
approbation,
blame,
pity,
emulation,
envy,
have
a
plainreference
to
the
state
and
situation
of
man,
and
are
calculated
forpreserving
the
existence
and
promoting
the
activity
of
such
a
being
insuch
circumstances.
It
seems,
therefore,
unreasonable
to
transfer
suchsentiments
to
a
supreme
existence,
or
to
suppose
him
actuated
by
them;and
the
phenomena
besides
of
the
universe
will
not
support
us
in
such
atheory.
All
our
ideas,
derived
from
the
senses,
are
confessedly
false
andillusive;
and
cannot
therefore
be
supposed
to
have
place
in
a
supremeintelligence:
And
as
the
ideas
of
internal
sentiment,
added
to
those
ofthe
external
senses,
compose
the
whole
furniture
of
human
understanding,we
may
conclude,
that
none
of
the
materials
of
thought
are
in
any
respectsimilar
in
the
human
and
in
the
divine
intelligence.
Now,
as
to
themanner
of
thinking;
how
can
we
make
any
comparison
between
them,
orsuppose
them
any
wise
resembling?
Our
thought
is
fluctuating,
uncertain,fleeting,
successive,
and
compounded;
and
were
we
to
remove
thesecircumstances,
we
absolutely
annihilate
its
essence,
and
it
would
in
sucha
case
be
an
abuse
of
terms
to
apply
to
it
the
name
of
thought
or
reason.At
least
if
it
appear
more
pious
and
respectful
(as
it
really
is)
stillto
retain
these
terms,
when
we
mention
the
Supreme
Being,
we
ought
toacknowledge,
that
their
meaning,
in
that
case,
is
totallyincomprehensible;
and
that
the
infirmities
of
our
nature
do
not
permit
usto
reach
any
ideas
which
in
the
least
correspond
to
the
ineffablesublimity
of
the
Divine
attributes.PART
4It
seems
strange
to
me,
said
CLEANTHES,
that
you,
DEMEA,
who
are
sosincere
in
the
cause
of
religion,
should
still
maintain
the
mysterious,incomprehensible
nature
of
the
Deity,
and
should
insist
so
strenuouslythat
he
has
no
manner
of
likeness
or
resemblance
to
human
creatures.
TheDeity,
I
can
readily
allow,
possesses
many
powers
and
attributes
of
whichwe
can
have
no
comprehension:
But
if
our
ideas,
so
far
as
they
go,
be
notjust,
and
adequate,
and
correspondent
to
his
real
nature,
I
know
not
whatthere
is
in
this
subject
worth
insisting
on.
Is
the
name,
without
anymeaning,
of
such
mighty
importance?
Or
how
do
you
mystics,
who
maintainthe
absolute
incomprehensibility
of
the
Deity,
differ
from
Sceptics
orAtheists,
who
assert,
that
the
first
cause
of
all
is
unknown
andunintelligible?
Their
temerity
must
be
very
great,
if,
after
rejectingthe
production
by
a
mind,
I
mean
a
mind
resembling
the
human,
(for
I
knowof
no
other,)
they
pretend
to
assign,
with
certainty,
any
other
specificintelligible
cause:
And
their
conscience
must
be
very
scrupulous
indeed,if
they
refuse
to
call
the
universal
unknown
cause
a
God
or
Deity;
and
tobestow
on
him
as
many
sublime
eulogies
and
unmeaning
epithets
as
youshall
please
to
require
of
them.Who
could
imagine,
replied
DEMEA,
that
CLEANTHES,
the
calm
philosophicalCLEANTHES,
would
attempt
to
refute
his
antagonists
by
affixing
a
nicknameto
them;
and,
like
the
common
bigots
and
inquisitors
of
the
age,
haverecourse
to
invective
and
declamation,
instead
of
reasoning?
Or
does
henot
perceive,
that
these
topics
are
easily
retorted,
and
thatAnthropomorphite
is
an
appellation
as
invidious,
and
implies
as
dangerousconsequences,
as
the
epithet
of
Mystic,
with
which
he
has
honoured
us?
Inreality,
CLEANTHES,
consider
what
it
is
you
assert
when
you
represent
theDeity
as
similar
to
a
human
mind
and
understanding.
What
is
the
soul
ofman?
A
composition
of
various
faculties,
passions,
sentiments,
ideas;united,
indeed,
into
one
self
or
person,
but
still
distinct
from
eachother.
When
it
reasons,
the
ideas,
which
are
the
parts
of
its
discourse,arrange
themselves
in
a
certain
form
or
order;
which
is
not
preservedentire
for
a
moment,
but
immediately
gives
place
to
another
arrangement.New
opinions,
new
passions,
new
affections,
new
feelings
arise,
whichcontinually
diversify
the
mental
scene,
and
produce
in
it
the
greatestvariety
and
most
rapid
succession
imaginable.
How
is
this
compatible
withthat
perfect
immutability
and
simplicity
which
all
true
Theists
ascribeto
the
Deity?
By
the
same
act,
say
they,
he
sees
past,
present,
andfuture:
His
love
and
hatred,
his
mercy
and
justice,
are
one
individualoperation:
He
is
entire
in
every
point
of
space;
and
complete
in
everyinstant
of
duration.
No
succession,
no
change,
no
acquisition,
nodiminution.
What
he
is
implies
not
in
it
any
shadow
of
distinction
ordiversity.
And
what
he
is
this
moment
he
ever
has
been,
and
ever
will
be,without
any
new
judgement,
sentiment,
or
operation.
He
stands
fixed
inone
simple,
perfect
state:
nor
can
you
ever
say,
with
any
propriety,
thatthis
act
of
his
is
different
from
that
other;
or
that
this
judgement
oridea
has
been
lately
formed,
and
will
give
place,
by
succession,
to
anydifferent
judgement
or
idea.I
can
readily
allow,
said
CLEANTHES,
that
those
who
maintain
the
perfectsimplicity
of
the
Supreme
Being,
to
the
extent
in
which
you
haveexplained
it,
are
complete
Mystics,
and
chargeable
with
all
theconsequences
which
I
have
drawn
from
their
opinion.
They
are,
in
a
word,Atheists,
without
knowing
it.
For
though
it
be
allowed,
that
the
Deitypossesses
attributes
of
which
we
have
no
comprehension,
yet
ought
wenever
to
ascribe
to
him
any
attributes
which
are
absolutely
incompatiblewith
that
intelligent
nature
essential
to
him.
A
mind,
whose
acts
andsentiments
and
ideas
are
not
distinct
and
successive;
one,
that
is
whollysimple,
and
totally
immutable,
is
a
mind
which
has
no
thought,
no
reason,no
will,
no
sentiment,
no
love,
no
hatred;
or,
in
a
word,
is
no
mind
atall.
It
is
an
abuse
of
terms
to
give
it
that
appellation;
and
we
may
aswell
speak
of
limited
extension
without
figure,
or
of
number
withoutcomposition.Pray
consider,
said
PHILO,
whom
you
are
at
present
inveighing
against.You
are
honouring
with
the
appellation
of
Atheist
all
the
sound,
orthodoxdivines,
almost,
who
have
treated
of
this
subject;
and
you
will
at
lastbe,
yourself,
found,
according
to
your
reckoning,
the
only
sound
Theistin
the
world.
But
if
idolaters
be
Atheists,
as,
I
think,
may
justly
beasserted,
and
Christian
Theologians
the
same,
what
becomes
of
theargument,
so
much
celebrated,
derived
from
the
universal
consent
ofmankind?But
because
I
know
you
are
not
much
swayed
by
names
and
authorities,
Ishall
endeavour
to
show
you,
a
little
more
distinctly,
the
inconveniencesof
that
Anthropomorphism,
which
you
have
embraced;
and
shall
prove,
thatthere
is
no
ground
to
suppose
a
plan
of
the
world
to
be
formed
in
theDivine
mind,
consisting
of
distinct
ideas,
differently
arranged,
in
thesame
manner
as
an
architect
forms
in
his
head
the
plan
of
a
house
whichhe
intends
to
execute.It
is
not
easy,
I
own,
to
see
what
is
gained
by
this
supposition,
whetherwe
judge
of
the
matter
by
Reason
or
by
Experience.
We
are
still
obligedto
mount
higher,
in
order
to
find
the
cause
of
this
cause,
which
you
hadassigned
as
satisfactory
and
conclusive.If
Reason
(I
mean
abstract
reason,
derived
from
inquiries
a
priori)
benot
alike
mute
with
regard
to
all
questions
concerning
cause
and
effect,this
sentence
at
least
it
will
venture
to
pronounce,
That
a
mental
world,or
universe
of
ideas,
requires
a
cause
as
much,
as
does
a
material
world,or
universe
of
objects;
and,
if
similar
in
its
arrangement,
must
requirea
similar
cause.
For
what
is
there
in
this
subject,
which
should
occasiona
different
conclusion
or
inference?
In
an
abstract
view,
they
areentirely
alike;
and
no
difficulty
attends
the
one
supposition,
which
isnot
common
to
both
of
them.Again,
when
we
will
needs
force
Experience
to
pronounce
some
sentence,even
on
these
subjects
which
lie
beyond
her
sphere,
neither
can
sheperceive
any
material
difference
in
this
particular,
between
these
twokinds
of
worlds;
but
finds
them
to
be
governed
by
similar
principles,
andto
depend
upon
an
equal
variety
of
causes
in
their
operations.
We
havespecimens
in
miniature
of
both
of
them.
Our
own
mind
resembles
the
one;
avegetable
or
animal
body
the
other.
Let
experience,
therefore,
judge
fromthese
samples.
Nothing
seems
more
delicate,
with
regard
to
its
causes,than
thought;
and
as
these
causes
never
operate
in
two
persons
after
thesame
manner,
so
we
never
find
two
persons
who
think
exactly
alike.
Norindeed
does
the
same
person
think
exactly
alike
at
any
two
differentperiods
of
time.
A
difference
of
age,
of
the
disposition
of
his
body,
ofweather,
of
food,
of
company,
of
books,
of
passions;
any
of
theseparticulars,
or
others
more
minute,
are
sufficient
to
alter
the
curiousmachinery
of
thought,
and
communicate
to
it
very
different
movements
andoperations.
As
far
as
we
can
judge,
vegetables
and
animal
bodies
are
notmore
delicate
in
their
motions,
nor
depend
upon
a
greater
variety
or
morecurious
adjustment
of
springs
and
principles.How,
therefore,
shall
we
satisfy
ourselves
concerning
the
cause
of
thatBeing
whom
you
suppose
the
Author
of
Nature,
or,
according
to
your
systemof
Anthropomorphism,
the
ideal
world,
into
which
you
trace
the
material?Have
we
not
the
same
reason
to
trace
that
ideal
world
into
another
idealworld,
or
new
intelligent
principle?
But
if
we
stop,
and
go
no
further;why
go
so
far?
why
not
stop
at
the
material
world?
How
can
we
satisfyourselves
without
going
on
in
infinitum?
And,
after
all,
whatsatisfaction
is
there
in
that
infinite
progression?
Let
us
remember
thestory
of
the
Indian
philosopher
and
his
elephant.
It
was
never
moreapplicable
than
to
the
present
subject.
If
the
material
world
rests
upona
similar
ideal
world,
this
ideal
world
must
rest
upon
some
other;
and
soon,
without
end.
It
were
better,
therefore,
never
to
look
beyond
thepresent
material
world.
By
supposing
it
to
contain
the
principle
of
itsorder
within
itself,
we
really
assert
it
to
be
God;
and
the
sooner
wearrive
at
that
Divine
Being,
so
much
the
better.
When
you
go
one
stepbeyond
the
mundane
system,
you
only
excite
an
inquisitive
humour
which
itis
impossible
ever
to
satisfy.To
say,
that
the
different
ideas
which
compose
the
reason
of
the
SupremeBeing,
fall
into
order
of
themselves,
and
by
their
own
nature,
is
reallyto
talk
without
any
precise
meaning.
If
it
has
a
meaning,
I
would
fainknow,
why
it
is
not
as
good
sense
to
say,
that
the
parts
of
the
materialworld
fall
into
order
of
themselves
and
by
their
own
nature.
Can
the
oneopinion
be
intelligible,
while
the
other
is
not
so?We
have,
indeed,
experience
of
ideas
which
fall
into
order
of
themselves,and
without
any
known
cause.
But,
I
am
sure,
we
have
a
much
largerexperience
of
matter
which
does
the
same;
as,
in
all
instances
ofgeneration
and
vegetation,
where
the
accurate
analysis
of
the
causeexceeds
all
human
comprehension.
We
have
also
experience
of
particularsystems
of
thought
and
of
matter
which
have
no
order;
of
the
first
inmadness,
of
the
second
in
corruption.
Why,
then,
should
we
think,
thatorder
is
more
essential
to
one
than
the
other?
And
if
it
requires
a
causein
both,
what
do
we
gain
by
your
system,
in
tracing
the
universe
ofobjects
into
a
similar
universe
of
ideas?
The
first
step
which
we
makeleads
us
on
for
ever.
It
were,
therefore,
wise
in
us
to
limit
all
ourinquiries
to
the
present
world,
without
looking
further.
No
satisfactioncan
ever
be
attained
by
these
speculations,
which
so
far
exceed
thenarrow
bounds
of
human
understanding.It
was
usual
with
the
PERIPATETICS,
you
know,
CLEANTHES,
when
the
causeof
any
phenomenon
was
demanded,
to
have
recourse
to
their
faculties
oroccult
qualities;
and
to
say,
for
instance,
that
bread
nourished
by
itsnutritive
faculty,
and
senna
purged
by
its
purgative.
But
it
has
beendiscovered,
that
this
subterfuge
was
nothing
but
the
disguise
ofignorance;
and
that
these
philosophers,
though
less
ingenuous,
reallysaid
the
same
thing
with
the
sceptics
or
the
vulgar,
who
fairly
confessedthat
they
knew
not
the
cause
of
these
phenomena.
In
like
manner,
when
itis
asked,
what
cause
produces
order
in
the
ideas
of
the
Supreme
Being;can
any
other
reason
be
assigned
by
you,
Anthropomorphites,
than
that
itis
a
rational
faculty,
and
that
such
is
the
nature
of
the
Deity?
But
whya
similar
answer
will
not
be
equally
satisfactory
in
accounting
for
theorder
of
the
world,
without
having
recourse
to
any
such
intelligentcreator
as
you
insist
on,
may
be
difficult
to
determine.
It
is
only
tosay,
that
such
is
the
nature
of
material
objects,
and
that
they
are
alloriginally
possessed
of
a
faculty
of
order
and
proportion.
These
are
onlymore
learned
and
elaborate
ways
of
confessing
our
ignorance;
nor
has
theone
hypothesis
any
real
advantage
above
the
other,
except
in
its
greaterconformity
to
vulgar
prejudices.You
have
displayed
this
argument
with
great
emphasis,
replied
CLEANTHES:You
seem
not
sensible
how
easy
it
is
to
answer
it.
Even
in
common
life,if
I
assign
a
cause
for
any
event,
is
it
any
objection,
PHILO,
that
Icannot
assign
the
cause
of
that
cause,
and
answer
every
new
questionwhich
may
incessantly
be
started?
And
what
philosophers
could
possiblysubmit
to
so
rigid
a
rule?
philosophers,
who
confess
ultimate
causes
tobe
totally
unknown;
and
are
sensible,
that
the
most
refined
principlesinto
which
they
trace
the
phenomena,
are
still
to
them
as
inexplicable
asthese
phenomena
themselves
are
to
the
vulgar.
The
order
and
arrangementof
nature,
the
curious
adjustment
of
final
causes,
the
plain
use
andintention
of
every
part
and
organ;
all
these
bespeak
in
the
clearestlanguage
an
intelligent
cause
or
author.
The
heavens
and
the
earth
joinin
the
same
testimony:
The
whole
chorus
of
Nature
raises
one
hymn
to
thepraises
of
its
Creator.
You
alone,
or
almost
alone,
disturb
this
generalharmony.
You
start
abstruse
doubts,
cavils,
and
objections:
You
ask
me,what
is
the
cause
of
this
cause?
I
know
not;
I
care
not;
that
concernsnot
me.
I
have
found
a
Deity;
and
here
I
stop
my
inquiry.
Let
those
gofurther,
who
are
wiser
or
more
enterprising.I
pretend
to
be
neither,
replied
PHILO:
And
for
that
very
reason,
Ishould
never
perhaps
have
attempted
to
go
so
far;
especially
when
I
amsensible,
that
I
must
at
last
be
contented
to
sit
down
with
the
sameanswer,
which,
without
further
trouble,
might
have
satisfied
me
from
thebeginning.
If
I
am
still
to
remain
in
utter
ignorance
of
causes,
and
canabsolutely
give
an
explication
of
nothing,
I
shall
never
esteem
it
anyadvantage
to
shove
off
for
a
moment
a
difficulty,
which,
you
acknowledge,must
immediately,
in
its
full
force,
recur
upon
me.
Naturalists
indeedvery
justly
explain
particular
effects
by
more
general
causes,
thoughthese
general
causes
themselves
should
remain
in
the
end
totallyinexplicable;
but
they
never
surely
thought
it
satisfactory
to
explain
aparticular
effect
by
a
particular
cause,
which
was
no
more
to
beaccounted
for
than
the
effect
itself.
An
ideal
system,
arranged
ofitself,
without
a
precedent
design,
is
not
a
whit
more
explicable
than
amaterial
one,
which
attains
its
order
in
a
like
manner;
nor
is
there
anymore
difficulty
in
the
latter
supposition
than
in
the
former.PART
5But
to
show
you
still
more
inconveniences,
continued
PHILO,
in
yourAnthropomorphism,
please
to
take
a
new
survey
of
your
principles.
Likeeffects
prove
like
causes.
This
is
the
experimental
argument;
and
this,you
say
too,
is
the
sole
theological
argument.
Now,
it
is
certain,
thatthe
liker
the
effects
are
which
are
seen,
and
the
liker
the
causes
whichare
inferred,
the
stronger
is
the
argument.
Every
departure
on
eitherside
diminishes
the
probability,
and
renders
the
experiment
lessconclusive.
You
cannot
doubt
of
the
principle;
neither
ought
you
toreject
its
consequences.All
the
new
discoveries
in
astronomy,
which
prove
the
immense
grandeurand
magnificence
of
the
works
of
Nature,
are
so
many
additional
argumentsfor
a
Deity,
according
to
the
true
system
of
Theism;
but,
according
toyour
hypothesis
of
experimental
Theism,
they
become
so
many
objections,by
removing
the
effect
still
further
from
all
resemblance
to
the
effectsof
human
art
and
contrivance.
For,
if
LUCRETIUS[Lib.
II.
1094],
evenfollowing
the
old
system
of
the
world,
could
exclaim,
Quis
regere

quis

Indu

Quis

et

feraces?
Omnibus

TULLY
[De.

esteemed
this
reasoning
so
natural,as
to
put
it
into
the
mouth
of
his
EPICUREAN:"Quibus
enim
oculis
animi
intueri
potuit
vester
Plato
fabricam
illamtanti
operis,
qua
construi
a
Deo
atque
aedificari

qui
ministri
tantimuneris
fuerunt?
quemadmodum
autem
obedire
et
parere
voluntati
architectiaer,
ignis,
aqua,
terra
potuerunt?"If
this
argument,
I
say,
had
any
force
in
former
ages,
how
much
greatermust
it
have
at
present,
when
the
bounds
of
Nature
are
so
infinitelyenlarged,
and
such
a
magnificent
scene
is
opened
to
us?
It
is
still
moreunreasonable
to
form
our
idea
of
so
unlimited
a
cause
from
our
experienceof
the
narrow
productions
of
human
design
and
invention.The
discoveries
by
microscopes,
as
they
open
a
new
universe
in
miniature,are
still
objections,
according
to
you,
arguments,
according
to
me.
Thefurther
we
push
our
researches
of
this
kind,
we
are
still
led
to
inferthe
universal
cause
of
all
to
be
vastly
different
from
mankind,
or
fromany
object
of
human
experience
and
observation.And
what
say
you
to
the
discoveries
in
anatomy,
chemistry,
botany?...These
surely
are
no
objections,
replied
CLEANTHES;
they
only
discover
newinstances
of
art
and
contrivance.
It
is
still
the
image
of
mind
reflectedon
us
from
innumerable
objects.
Add,
a
mind
like
the
human,
said
PHILO.
Iknow
of
no
other,
replied
CLEANTHES.
And
the
liker
the
better,
insistedPHILO.
To
be
sure,
said
CLEANTHES.Now,
CLEANTHES,
said
PHILO,
with
an
air
of
alacrity
and
triumph,
mark
theconsequences.
First,
By
this
method
of
reasoning,
you
renounce
all
claimto
infinity
in
any
of
the
attributes
of
the
Deity.
For,
as
the
causeought
only
to
be
proportioned
to
the
effect,
and
the
effect,
so
far
as
itfalls
under
our
cognisance,
is
not
infinite;
what
pretensions
have
we,upon
your
suppositions,
to
ascribe
that
attribute
to
the
Divine
Being?You
will
still
insist,
that,
by
removing
him
so
much
from
all
similarityto
human
creatures,
we
give
in
to
the
most
arbitrary
hypothesis,
and
atthe
same
time
weaken
all
proofs
of
his
existence.Secondly,
You
have
no
reason,
on
your
theory,
for
ascribing
perfection
tothe
Deity,
even
in
his
finite
capacity,
or
for
supposing
him
free
fromevery
error,
mistake,
or
incoherence,
in
his
undertakings.
There
are
manyinexplicable
difficulties
in
the
works
of
Nature,
which,
if
we
allow
aperfect
author
to
be
proved
a
priori,
are
easily
solved,
and
become
onlyseeming
difficulties,
from
the
narrow
capacity
of
man,
who
cannot
traceinfinite
relations.
But
according
to
your
method
of
reasoning,
thesedifficulties
become
all
real;
and
perhaps
will
be
insisted
on,
as
newinstances
of
likeness
to
human
art
and
contrivance.
At
least,
you
mustacknowledge,
that
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
tell,
from
our
limitedviews,
whether
this
system
contains
any
great
faults,
or
deserves
anyconsiderable
praise,
if
compared
to
other
possible,
and
even
realsystems.
Could
a
peasant,
if
the
Aeneid
were
read
to
him,
pronounce
thatpoem
to
be
absolutely
faultless,
or
even
assign
to
it
its
proper
rankamong
the
productions
of
human
wit,
he,
who
had
never
seen
any
otherproduction?But
were
this
world
ever
so
perfect
a
production,
it
must
still
remainuncertain,
whether
all
the
excellences
of
the
work
can
justly
be
ascribedto
the
workman.
If
we
survey
a
ship,
what
an
exalted
idea
must
we
form
ofthe
ingenuity
of
the
carpenter
who
framed
so
complicated,
useful,
andbeautiful
a
machine?
And
what
surprise
must
we
feel,
when
we
find
him
astupid
mechanic,
who
imitated
others,
and
copied
an
art,
which,
through
along
succession
of
ages,
after
multiplied
trials,
mistakes,
corrections,deliberations,
and
controversies,
had
been
gradually
improving?
Manyworlds
might
have
been
botched
and
bungled,
throughout
an
eternity,
erethis
system
was
struck
out;
much
labour
lost,
many
fruitless
trials
made;and
a
slow,
but
continued
improvement
carried
on
during
infinite
ages
inthe
art
of
world-making.
In
such
subjects,
who
can
determine,
where
thetruth;
nay,
who
can
conjecture
where
the
probability
lies,
amidst
a
greatnumber
of
hypotheses
which
may
be
proposed,
and
a
still
greater
which
maybe
imagined?And
what
shadow
of
an
argument,
continued
PHILO,
can
you
produce,
fromyour
hypothesis,
to
prove
the
unity
of
the
Deity?
A
great
number
of
menjoin
in
building
a
house
or
ship,
in
rearing
a
city,
in
framing
acommonwealth;
why
may
not
several
deities
combine
in
contriving
andframing
a
world?
This
is
only
so
much
greater
similarity
to
humanaffairs.
By
sharing
the
work
among
several,
we
may
so
much
further
limitthe
attributes
of
each,
and
get
rid
of
that
extensive
power
andknowledge,
which
must
be
supposed
in
one
deity,
and
which,
according
toyou,
can
only
serve
to
weaken
the
proof
of
his
existence.
And
if
suchfoolish,
such
vicious
creatures
as
man,
can
yet
often
unite
in
framingand
executing
one
plan,
how
much
more
those
deities
or
demons,
whom
wemay
suppose
several
degrees
more
perfect!To
multiply
causes
without
necessity,
is
indeed
contrary
to
truephilosophy:
but
this
principle
applies
not
to
the
present
case.
Were
onedeity
antecedently
proved
by
your
theory,
who
were
possessed
of
everyattribute
requisite
to
the
production
of
the
universe;
it
would
beneedless,
I
own,
(though
not
absurd,)
to
suppose
any
other
deityexistent.
But
while
it
is
still
a
question,
Whether
all
these
attributesare
united
in
one
subject,
or
dispersed
among
several
independent
beings,by
what
phenomena
in
nature
can
we
pretend
to
decide
the
controversy?Where
we
see
a
body
raised
in
a
scale,
we
are
sure
that
there
is
in
theopposite
scale,
however
concealed
from
sight,
some
counterpoising
weightequal
to
it;
but
it
is
still
allowed
to
doubt,
whether
that
weight
be
anaggregate
of
several
distinct
bodies,
or
one
uniform
united
mass.
And
ifthe
weight
requisite
very
much
exceeds
any
thing
which
we
have
ever
seenconjoined
in
any
single
body,
the
former
supposition
becomes
still
moreprobable
and
natural.
An
intelligent
being
of
such
vast
power
andcapacity
as
is
necessary
to
produce
the
universe,
or,
to
speak
in
thelanguage
of
ancient
philosophy,
so
prodigious
an
animal
exceeds
allanalogy,
and
even
comprehension.But
further,
CLEANTHES:
men
are
mortal,
and
renew
their
species
bygeneration;
and
this
is
common
to
all
living
creatures.
The
two
greatsexes
of
male
and
female,
says
MILTON,
animate
the
world.
Why
must
thiscircumstance,
so
universal,
so
essential,
be
excluded
from
those
numerousand
limited
deities?
Behold,
then,
the
theogony
of
ancient
times
broughtback
upon
us.And
why
not
become
a
perfect
Anthropomorphite?
Why
not
assert
the
deityor
deities
to
be
corporeal,
and
to
have
eyes,
a
nose,
mouth,
ears,
&c.?EPICURUS
maintained,
that
no
man
had
ever
seen
reason
but
in
a
humanfigure;
therefore
the
gods
must
have
a
human
figure.
And
this
argument,which
is
deservedly
so
much
ridiculed
by
CICERO,
becomes,
according
toyou,
solid
and
philosophical.In
a
word,
CLEANTHES,
a
man
who
follows
your
hypothesis
is
able
perhapsto
assert,
or
conjecture,
that
the
universe,
sometime,
arose
fromsomething
like
design:
but
beyond
that
position
he
cannot
ascertain
onesingle
circumstance;
and
is
left
afterwards
to
fix
every
point
of
histheology
by
the
utmost
license
of
fancy
and
hypothesis.
This
world,
foraught
he
knows,
is
very
faulty
and
imperfect,
compared
to
a
superiorstandard;
and
was
only
the
first
rude
essay
of
some
infant
deity,
whoafterwards
abandoned
it,
ashamed
of
his
lame
performance:
it
is
the
workonly
of
some
dependent,
inferior
deity;
and
is
the
object
of
derision
tohis
superiors:
it
is
the
production
of
old
age
and
dotage
in
somesuperannuated
deity;
and
ever
since
his
death,
has
run
on
at
adventures,from
the
first
impulse
and
active
force
which
it
received
from
him.
Youjustly
give
signs
of
horror,
DEMEA,
at
these
strange
suppositions;
butthese,
and
a
thousand
more
of
the
same
kind,
are
CLEANTHES'ssuppositions,
not
mine.
From
the
moment
the
attributes
of
the
Deity
aresupposed
finite,
all
these
have
place.
And
I
cannot,
for
my
part,
thinkthat
so
wild
and
unsettled
a
system
of
theology
is,
in
any
respect,preferable
to
none
at
all.These
suppositions
I
absolutely
disown,
cried
CLEANTHES:
they
strike
me,however,
with
no
horror,
especially
when
proposed
in
that
rambling
way
inwhich
they
drop
from
you.
On
the
contrary,
they
give
me
pleasure,
when
Isee,
that,
by
the
utmost
indulgence
of
your
imagination,
you
never
getrid
of
the
hypothesis
of
design
in
the
universe,
but
are
obliged
at
everyturn
to
have
recourse
to
it.
To
this
concession
I
adhere
steadily;
andthis
I
regard
as
a
sufficient
foundation
for
religion.PART
6It
must
be
a
slight
fabric,
indeed,
said
DEMEA,
which
can
be
erected
onso
tottering
a
foundation.
While
we
are
uncertain
whether
there
is
onedeity
or
many;
whether
the
deity
or
deities,
to
whom
we
owe
ourexistence,
be
perfect
or
imperfect,
subordinate
or
supreme,
dead
oralive,
what
trust
or
confidence
can
we
repose
in
them?
What
devotion
orworship
address
to
them?
What
veneration
or
obedience
pay
them?
To
allthe
purposes
of
life
the
theory
of
religion
becomes
altogether
useless:and
even
with
regard
to
speculative
consequences,
its
uncertainty,according
to
you,
must
render
it
totally
precarious
and
unsatisfactory.To
render
it
still
more
unsatisfactory,
said
PHILO,
there
occurs
to
meanother
hypothesis,
which
must
acquire
an
air
of
probability
from
themethod
of
reasoning
so
much
insisted
on
by
CLEANTHES.
That
like
effectsarise
from
like
causes:
this
principle
he
supposes
the
foundation
of
allreligion.
But
there
is
another
principle
of
the
same
kind,
no
lesscertain,
and
derived
from
the
same
source
of
experience;
that
whereseveral
known
circumstances
are
observed
to
be
similar,
the
unknown
willalso
be
found
similar.
Thus,
if
we
see
the
limbs
of
a
human
body,
weconclude
that
it
is
also
attended
with
a
human
head,
though
hid
from
us.Thus,
if
we
see,
through
a
chink
in
a
wall,
a
small
part
of
the
sun,
weconclude,
that,
were
the
wall
removed,
we
should
see
the
whole
body.
Inshort,
this
method
of
reasoning
is
so
obvious
and
familiar,
that
noscruple
can
ever
be
made
with
regard
to
its
solidity.Now,
if
we
survey
the
universe,
so
far
as
it
falls
under
our
knowledge,it
bears
a
great
resemblance
to
an
animal
or
organised
body,
and
seemsactuated
with
a
like
principle
of
life
and
motion.
A
continualcirculation
of
matter
in
it
produces
no
disorder:
a
continual
waste
inevery
part
is
incessantly
repaired:
the
closest
sympathy
is
perceivedthroughout
the
entire
system:
and
each
part
or
member,
in
performing
itsproper
offices,
operates
both
to
its
own
preservation
and
to
that
of
thewhole.
The
world,
therefore,
I
infer,
is
an
animal;
and
the
Deity
is
theSOUL
of
the
world,
actuating
it,
and
actuated
by
it.You
have
too
much
learning,
CLEANTHES,
to
be
at
all
surprised
at
thisopinion,
which,
you
know,
was
maintained
by
almost
all
the
Theists
ofantiquity,
and
chiefly
prevails
in
their
discourses
and
reasonings.
Forthough,
sometimes,
the
ancient
philosophers
reason
from
final
causes,
asif
they
thought
the
world
the
workmanship
of
God;
yet
it
appears
rathertheir
favourite
notion
to
consider
it
as
his
body,
whose
organisationrenders
it
subservient
to
him.
And
it
must
be
confessed,
that,
as
theuniverse
resembles
more
a
human
body
than
it
does
the
works
of
human
artand
contrivance,
if
our
limited
analogy
could
ever,
with
any
propriety,be
extended
to
the
whole
of
nature,
the
inference
seems
juster
in
favourof
the
ancient
than
the
modern
theory.There
are
many
other
advantages,
too,
in
the
former
theory,
whichrecommended
it
to
the
ancient
theologians.
Nothing
more
repugnant
to
alltheir
notions,
because
nothing
more
repugnant
to
common
experience,
thanmind
without
body;
a
mere
spiritual
substance,
which
fell
not
under
theirsenses
nor
comprehension,
and
of
which
they
had
not
observed
one
singleinstance
throughout
all
nature.
Mind
and
body
they
knew,
because
theyfelt
both:
an
order,
arrangement,
organisation,
or
internal
machinery,
inboth,
they
likewise
knew,
after
the
same
manner:
and
it
could
not
butseem
reasonable
to
transfer
this
experience
to
the
universe;
and
tosuppose
the
divine
mind
and
body
to
be
also
coeval,
and
to
have,
both
ofthem,
order
and
arrangement
naturally
inherent
in
them,
and
inseparablefrom
them.Here,
therefore,
is
a
new
species
of
Anthropomorphism,
CLEANTHES,
onwhich
you
may
deliberate;
and
a
theory
which
seems
not
liable
to
anyconsiderable
difficulties.
You
are
too
much
superior,
surely,
tosystematical
prejudices,
to
find
any
more
difficulty
in
supposing
ananimal
body
to
be,
originally,
of
itself,
or
from
unknown
causes,possessed
of
order
and
organisation,
than
in
supposing
a
similar
order
tobelong
to
mind.
But
the
vulgar
prejudice,
that
body
and
mind
ought
alwaysto
accompany
each
other,
ought
not,
one
should
think,
to
be
entirelyneglected;
since
it
is
founded
on
vulgar
experience,
the
only
guide
whichyou
profess
to
follow
in
all
these
theological
inquiries.
And
if
youassert,
that
our
limited
experience
is
an
unequal
standard,
by
which
tojudge
of
the
unlimited
extent
of
nature;
you
entirely
abandon
your
ownhypothesis,
and
must
thenceforward
adopt
our
Mysticism,
as
you
call
it,and
admit
of
the
absolute
incomprehensibility
of
the
Divine
Nature.This
theory,
I
own,
replied
CLEANTHES,
has
never
before
occurred
to
me,though
a
pretty
natural
one;
and
I
cannot
readily,
upon
so
short
anexamination
and
reflection,
deliver
any
opinion
with
regard
to
it.
Youare
very
scrupulous,
indeed,
said
PHILO:
were
I
to
examine
any
system
ofyours,
I
should
not
have
acted
with
half
that
caution
and
reserve,
instarting
objections
and
difficulties
to
it.
However,
if
any
thing
occurto
you,
you
will
oblige
us
by
proposing
it.Why
then,
replied
CLEANTHES,
it
seems
to
me,
that,
though
the
world
does,in
many
circumstances,
resemble
an
animal
body;
yet
is
the
analogy
alsodefective
in
many
circumstances
the
most
material:
no
organs
of
sense;
noseat
of
thought
or
reason;
no
one
precise
origin
of
motion
and
action.
Inshort,
it
seems
to
bear
a
stronger
resemblance
to
a
vegetable
than
to
ananimal,
and
your
inference
would
be
so
far
inconclusive
in
favour
of
thesoul
of
the
world.But,
in
the
next
place,
your
theory
seems
to
imply
the
eternity
of
theworld;
and
that
is
a
principle,
which,
I
think,
can
be
refuted
by
thestrongest
reasons
and
probabilities.
I
shall
suggest
an
argument
to
thispurpose,
which,
I
believe,
has
not
been
insisted
on
by
any
writer.
Those,who
reason
from
the
late
origin
of
arts
and
sciences,
though
theirinference
wants
not
force,
may
perhaps
be
refuted
by
considerationsderived
from
the
nature
of
human
society,
which
is
in
continualrevolution,
between
ignorance
and
knowledge,
liberty
and
slavery,
richesand
poverty;
so
that
it
is
impossible
for
us,
from
our
limitedexperience,
to
foretell
with
assurance
what
events
may
or
may
not
beexpected.
Ancient
learning
and
history
seem
to
have
been
in
great
dangerof
entirely
perishing
after
the
inundation
of
the
barbarous
nations;
andhad
these
convulsions
continued
a
little
longer,
or
been
a
little
moreviolent,
we
should
not
probably
have
now
known
what
passed
in
the
world
afew
centuries
before
us.
Nay,
were
it
not
for
the
superstition
of
thePopes,
who
preserved
a
little
jargon
of
Latin,
in
order
to
support
theappearance
of
an
ancient
and
universal
church,
that
tongue
must
have
beenutterly
lost;
in
which
case,
the
Western
world,
being
totally
barbarous,would
not
have
been
in
a
fit
disposition
for
receiving
the
GREEK
languageand
learning,
which
was
conveyed
to
them
after
the
sacking
ofCONSTANTINOPLE.
When
learning
and
books
had
been
extinguished,
even
themechanical
arts
would
have
fallen
considerably
to
decay;
and
it
is
easilyimagined,
that
fable
or
tradition
might
ascribe
to
them
a
much
laterorigin
than
the
true
one.
This
vulgar
argument,
therefore,
against
theeternity
of
the
world,
seems
a
little
precarious.But
here
appears
to
be
the
foundation
of
a
better
argument.
LUCULLUS
wasthe
first
that
brought
cherry-trees
from
ASIA
to
EUROPE;
though
that
treethrives
so
well
in
many
EUROPEAN
climates,
that
it
grows
in
the
woodswithout
any
culture.
Is
it
possible,
that
throughout
a
whole
eternity,
noEUROPEAN
had
ever
passed
into
ASIA,
and
thought
of
transplanting
sodelicious
a
fruit
into
his
own
country?
Or
if
the
tree
was
oncetransplanted
and
propagated,
how
could
it
ever
afterwards
perish?
Empiresmay
rise
and
fall,
liberty
and
slavery
succeed
alternately,
ignorance
andknowledge
give
place
to
each
other;
but
the
cherry-tree
will
still
remainin
the
woods
of
GREECE,
SPAIN,
and
ITALY,
and
will
never
be
affected
bythe
revolutions
of
human
society.It
is
not
two
thousand
years
since
vines
were
transplanted
into
FRANCE,though
there
is
no
climate
in
the
world
more
favourable
to
them.
It
isnot
three
centuries
since
horses,
cows,
sheep,
swine,
dogs,
corn,
wereknown
in
AMERICA.
Is
it
possible,
that
during
the
revolutions
of
a
wholeeternity,
there
never
arose
a
COLUMBUS,
who
might
open
the
communicationbetween
EUROPE
and
that
continent?
We
may
as
well
imagine,
that
all
menwould
wear
stockings
for
ten
thousand
years,
and
never
have
the
sense
tothink
of
garters
to
tie
them.
All
these
seem
convincing
proofs
of
theyouth,
or
rather
infancy,
of
the
world;
as
being
founded
on
the
operationof
principles
more
constant
and
steady
than
those
by
which
human
societyis
governed
and
directed.
Nothing
less
than
a
total
convulsion
of
theelements
will
ever
destroy
all
the
EUROPEAN
animals
and
vegetables
whichare
now
to
be
found
in
the
Western
world.And
what
argument
have
you
against
such
convulsions?
replied
PHILO.Strong
and
almost
incontestable
proofs
may
be
traced
over
the
wholeearth,
that
every
part
of
this
globe
has
continued
for
many
ages
entirelycovered
with
water.
And
though
order
were
supposed
inseparable
frommatter,
and
inherent
in
it;
yet
may
matter
be
susceptible
of
many
andgreat
revolutions,
through
the
endless
periods
of
eternal
duration.
Theincessant
changes,
to
which
every
part
of
it
is
subject,
seem
to
intimatesome
such
general
transformations;
though,
at
the
same
time,
it
isobservable,
that
all
the
changes
and
corruptions
of
which
we
have
everhad
experience,
are
but
passages
from
one
state
of
order
to
another;
norcan
matter
ever
rest
in
total
deformity
and
confusion.
What
we
see
in
theparts,
we
may
infer
in
the
whole;
at
least,
that
is
the
method
ofreasoning
on
which
you
rest
your
whole
theory.
And
were
I
obliged
todefend
any
particular
system
of
this
nature,
which
I
never
willinglyshould
do,
I
esteem
none
more
plausible
than
that
which
ascribes
aneternal
inherent
principle
of
order
to
the
world,
though
attended
withgreat
and
continual
revolutions
and
alterations.
This
at
once
solves
alldifficulties;
and
if
the
solution,
by
being
so
general,
is
not
entirelycomplete
and
satisfactory,
it
is
at
least
a
theory
that
we
must
sooner
orlater
have
recourse
to,
whatever
system
we
embrace.
How
could
things
havebeen
as
they
are,
were
there
not
an
original
inherent
principle
of
ordersomewhere,
in
thought
or
in
matter?
And
it
is
very
indifferent
to
whichof
these
we
give
the
preference.
Chance
has
no
place,
on
any
hypothesis,sceptical
or
religious.
Every
thing
is
surely
governed
by
steady,inviolable
laws.
And
were
the
inmost
essence
of
things
laid
open
to
us,we
should
then
discover
a
scene,
of
which,
at
present,
we
can
have
noidea.
Instead
of
admiring
the
order
of
natural
beings,
we
should
clearlysee
that
it
was
absolutely
impossible
for
them,
in
the
smallest
article,ever
to
admit
of
any
other
disposition.Were
any
one
inclined
to
revive
the
ancient
Pagan
Theology,
whichmaintained,
as
we
learn
from
HESIOD,
that
this
globe
was
governed
by30,000
deities,
who
arose
from
the
unknown
powers
of
nature:
you
wouldnaturally
object,
CLEANTHES,
that
nothing
is
gained
by
this
hypothesis;and
that
it
is
as
easy
to
suppose
all
men
animals,
beings
more
numerous,but
less
perfect,
to
have
sprung
immediately
from
a
like
origin.
Push
thesame
inference
a
step
further,
and
you
will
find
a
numerous
society
ofdeities
as
explicable
as
one
universal
deity,
who
possesses
withinhimself
the
powers
and
perfections
of
the
whole
society.
All
thesesystems,
then,
of
Scepticism,
Polytheism,
and
Theism,
you
must
allow,
onyour
principles,
to
be
on
a
like
footing,
and
that
no
one
of
them
has
anyadvantage
over
the
others.
You
may
thence
learn
the
fallacy
of
yourprinciples.PART
7But
here,
continued
PHILO,
in
examining
the
ancient
system
of
the
soul
ofthe
world,
there
strikes
me,
all
on
a
sudden,
a
new
idea,
which,
if
just,must
go
near
to
subvert
all
your
reasoning,
and
destroy
even
your
firstinferences,
on
which
you
repose
such
confidence.
If
the
universe
bears
agreater
likeness
to
animal
bodies
and
to
vegetables,
than
to
the
works
ofhuman
art,
it
is
more
probable
that
its
cause
resembles
the
cause
of
theformer
than
that
of
the
latter,
and
its
origin
ought
rather
to
beascribed
to
generation
or
vegetation,
than
to
reason
or
design.
Yourconclusion,
even
according
to
your
own
principles,
is
therefore
lame
anddefective.Pray
open
up
this
argument
a
little
further,
said
DEMEA,
for
I
do
notrightly
apprehend
it
in
that
concise
manner
in
which
you
have
expressedit.Our
friend
CLEANTHES,
replied
PHILO,
as
you
have
heard,
asserts,
thatsince
no
question
of
fact
can
be
proved
otherwise
than
by
experience,
theexistence
of
a
Deity
admits
not
of
proof
from
any
other
medium.
Theworld,
says
he,
resembles
the
works
of
human
contrivance;
therefore
itscause
must
also
resemble
that
of
the
other.
Here
we
may
remark,
that
theoperation
of
one
very
small
part
of
nature,
to
wit
man,
upon
another
verysmall
part,
to
wit
that
inanimate
matter
lying
within
his
reach,
is
therule
by
which
CLEANTHES
judges
of
the
origin
of
the
whole;
and
hemeasures
objects,
so
widely
disproportioned,
by
the
same
individualstandard.
But
to
waive
all
objections
drawn
from
this
topic,
I
affirm,that
there
are
other
parts
of
the
universe
(besides
the
machines
of
humaninvention)
which
bear
still
a
greater
resemblance
to
the
fabric
of
theworld,
and
which,
therefore,
afford
a
better
conjecture
concerning
theuniversal
origin
of
this
system.
These
parts
are
animals
and
vegetables.The
world
plainly
resembles
more
an
animal
or
a
vegetable,
than
it
does
awatch
or
a
knitting-loom.
Its
cause,
therefore,
it
is
more
probable,resembles
the
cause
of
the
former.
The
cause
of
the
former
is
generationor
vegetation.
The
cause,
therefore,
of
the
world,
we
may
infer
to
besomething
similar
or
analogous
to
generation
or
vegetation.But
how
is
it
conceivable,
said
DEMEA,
that
the
world
can
arise
from
anything
similar
to
vegetation
or
generation?Very
easily,
replied
PHILO.
In
like
manner
as
a
tree
sheds
its
seed
intothe
neighbouring
fields,
and
produces
other
trees;
so
the
greatvegetable,
the
world,
or
this
planetary
system,
produces
within
itselfcertain
seeds,
which,
being
scattered
into
the
surrounding
chaos,vegetate
into
new
worlds.
A
comet,
for
instance,
is
the
seed
of
a
world;and
after
it
has
been
fully
ripened,
by
passing
from
sun
to
sun,
and
starto
star,
it
is
at
last
tossed
into
the
unformed
elements
which
everywhere
surround
this
universe,
and
immediately
sprouts
up
into
a
newsystem.Or
if,
for
the
sake
of
variety
(for
I
see
no
other
advantage),
we
shouldsuppose
this
world
to
be
an
animal;
a
comet
is
the
egg
of
this
animal:and
in
like
manner
as
an
ostrich
lays
its
egg
in
the
sand,
which,
withoutany
further
care,
hatches
the
egg,
and
produces
a
new
animal;
so...I
understand
you,
says
DEMEA:
But
what
wild,
arbitrary
suppositions
arethese!
What
data
have
you
for
such
extraordinary
conclusions?
And
is
theslight,
imaginary
resemblance
of
the
world
to
a
vegetable
or
an
animalsufficient
to
establish
the
same
inference
with
regard
to
both?
Objects,which
are
in
general
so
widely
different,
ought
they
to
be
a
standard
foreach
other?Right,
cries
PHILO:
This
is
the
topic
on
which
I
have
all
along
insisted.I
have
still
asserted,
that
we
have
no
data
to
establish
any
system
ofcosmogony.
Our
experience,
so
imperfect
in
itself,
and
so
limited
both
inextent
and
duration,
can
afford
us
no
probable
conjecture
concerning
thewhole
of
things.
But
if
we
must
needs
fix
on
some
hypothesis;
by
whatrule,
pray,
ought
we
to
determine
our
choice?
Is
there
any
other
rulethan
the
greater
similarity
of
the
objects
compared?
And
does
not
a
plantor
an
animal,
which
springs
from
vegetation
or
generation,
bear
astronger
resemblance
to
the
world,
than
does
any
artificial
machine,which
arises
from
reason
and
design?But
what
is
this
vegetation
and
generation
of
which
you
talk?
said
DEMEA.Can
you
explain
their
operations,
and
anatomise
that
fine
internalstructure
on
which
they
depend?As
much,
at
least,
replied
PHILO,
as
CLEANTHES
can
explain
the
operationsof
reason,
or
anatomise
that
internal
structure
on
which
it
depends.
Butwithout
any
such
elaborate
disquisitions,
when
I
see
an
animal,
I
infer,that
it
sprang
from
generation;
and
that
with
as
great
certainty
as
youconclude
a
house
to
have
been
reared
by
design.
These
words,
generation,reason,
mark
only
certain
powers
and
energies
in
nature,
whose
effectsare
known,
but
whose
essence
is
incomprehensible;
and
one
of
theseprinciples,
more
than
the
other,
has
no
privilege
for
being
made
astandard
to
the
whole
of
nature.In
reality,
DEMEA,
it
may
reasonably
be
expected,
that
the
larger
theviews
are
which
we
take
of
things,
the
better
will
they
conduct
us
in
ourconclusions
concerning
such
extraordinary
and
such
magnificent
subjects.In
this
little
corner
of
the
world
alone,
there
are
four
principles,reason,
instinct,
generation,
vegetation,
which
are
similar
to
eachother,
and
are
the
causes
of
similar
effects.
What
a
number
of
otherprinciples
may
we
naturally
suppose
in
the
immense
extent
and
variety
ofthe
universe,
could
we
travel
from
planet
to
planet,
and
from
system
tosystem,
in
order
to
examine
each
part
of
this
mighty
fabric?
Any
one
ofthese
four
principles
above
mentioned,
(and
a
hundred
others
which
lieopen
to
our
conjecture,)
may
afford
us
a
theory
by
which
to
judge
of
theorigin
of
the
world;
and
it
is
a
palpable
and
egregious
partiality
toconfine
our
view
entirely
to
that
principle
by
which
our
own
mindsoperate.
Were
this
principle
more
intelligible
on
that
account,
such
apartiality
might
be
somewhat
excusable:
But
reason,
in
its
internalfabric
and
structure,
is
really
as
little
known
to
us
as
instinct
orvegetation;
and,
perhaps,
even
that
vague,
indeterminate
word,
Nature,
towhich
the
vulgar
refer
every
thing,
is
not
at
the
bottom
moreinexplicable.
The
effects
of
these
principles
are
all
known
to
us
fromexperience;
but
the
principles
themselves,
and
their
manner
of
operation,are
totally
unknown;
nor
is
it
less
intelligible,
or
less
conformable
toexperience,
to
say,
that
the
world
arose
by
vegetation,
from
a
seed
shedby
another
world,
than
to
say
that
it
arose
from
a
divine
reason
orcontrivance,
according
to
the
sense
in
which
CLEANTHES
understands
it.But
methinks,
said
DEMEA,
if
the
world
had
a
vegetative
quality,
andcould
sow
the
seeds
of
new
worlds
into
the
infinite
chaos,
this
powerwould
be
still
an
additional
argument
for
design
in
its
author.
Forwhence
could
arise
so
wonderful
a
faculty
but
from
design?
Or
how
canorder
spring
from
any
thing
which
perceives
not
that
order
which
itbestows?You
need
only
look
around
you,
replied
PHILO,
to
satisfy
yourself
withregard
to
this
question.
A
tree
bestows
order
and
organisation
on
thattree
which
springs
from
it,
without
knowing
the
order;
an
animal
in
thesame
manner
on
its
offspring;
a
bird
on
its
nest;
and
instances
of
thiskind
are
even
more
frequent
in
the
world
than
those
of
order,
which
arisefrom
reason
and
contrivance.
To
say,
that
all
this
order
in
animals
andvegetables
proceeds
ultimately
from
design,
is
begging
the
question;
norcan
that
great
point
be
ascertained
otherwise
than
by
proving,
a
priori,both
that
order
is,
from
its
nature,
inseparably
attached
to
thought;
andthat
it
can
never
of
itself,
or
from
original
unknown
principles,
belongto
matter.But
further,
DEMEA;
this
objection
which
you
urge
can
never
be
made
useof
by
CLEANTHES,
without
renouncing
a
defence
which
he
has
already
madeagainst
one
of
my
objections.
When
I
inquired
concerning
the
cause
ofthat
supreme
reason
and
intelligence
into
which
he
resolves
every
thing;he
told
me,
that
the
impossibility
of
satisfying
such
inquiries
couldnever
be
admitted
as
an
objection
in
any
species
of
philosophy.
"We
muststop
somewhere",
says
he;
"nor
is
it
ever
within
the
reach
of
humancapacity
to
explain
ultimate
causes,
or
show
the
last
connections
of
anyobjects.
It
is
sufficient,
if
any
steps,
so
far
as
we
go,
are
supportedby
experience
and
observation."
Now,
that
vegetation
and
generation,
aswell
as
reason,
are
experienced
to
be
principles
of
order
in
nature,
isundeniable.
If
I
rest
my
system
of
cosmogony
on
the
former,
preferably
tothe
latter,
it
is
at
my
choice.
The
matter
seems
entirely
arbitrary.
Andwhen
CLEANTHES
asks
me
what
is
the
cause
of
my
great
vegetative
orgenerative
faculty,
I
am
equally
entitled
to
ask
him
the
cause
of
hisgreat
reasoning
principle.
These
questions
we
have
agreed
to
forbear
onboth
sides;
and
it
is
chiefly
his
interest
on
the
present
occasion
tostick
to
this
agreement.
Judging
by
our
limited
and
imperfect
experience,generation
has
some
privileges
above
reason:
for
we
see
every
day
thelatter
arise
from
the
former,
never
the
former
from
the
latter.Compare,
I
beseech
you,
the
consequences
on
both
sides.
The
world,
say
I,resembles
an
animal;
therefore
it
is
an
animal,
therefore
it
arose
fromgeneration.
The
steps,
I
confess,
are
wide;
yet
there
is
some
smallappearance
of
analogy
in
each
step.
The
world,
says
CLEANTHES,
resemblesa
machine;
therefore
it
is
a
machine,
therefore
it
arose
from
design.
Thesteps
are
here
equally
wide,
and
the
analogy
less
striking.
And
if
hepretends
to
carry
on
my
hypothesis
a
step
further,
and
to
infer
design
orreason
from
the
great
principle
of
generation,
on
which
I
insist;
I
may,with
better
authority,
use
the
same
freedom
to
push
further
hishypothesis,
and
infer
a
divine
generation
or
theogony
from
his
principleof
reason.
I
have
at
least
some
faint
shadow
of
experience,
which
is
theutmost
that
can
ever
be
attained
in
the
present
subject.
Reason,
ininnumerable
instances,
is
observed
to
arise
from
the
principle
ofgeneration,
and
never
to
arise
from
any
other
principle.HESIOD,
and
all
the
ancient
mythologists,
were
so
struck
with
thisanalogy,
that
they
universally
explained
the
origin
of
nature
from
ananimal
birth,
and
copulation.
PLATO
too,
so
far
as
he
is
intelligible,seems
to
have
adopted
some
such
notion
in
his
TIMAEUS.The
BRAHMINS
assert,
that
the
world
arose
from
an
infinite
spider,
whospun
this
whole
complicated
mass
from
his
bowels,
and
annihilatesafterwards
the
whole
or
any
part
of
it,
by
absorbing
it
again,
andresolving
it
into
his
own
essence.
Here
is
a
species
of
cosmogony,
whichappears
to
us
ridiculous;
because
a
spider
is
a
little
contemptibleanimal,
whose
operations
we
are
never
likely
to
take
for
a
model
of
thewhole
universe.
But
still
here
is
a
new
species
of
analogy,
even
in
ourglobe.
And
were
there
a
planet
wholly
inhabited
by
spiders,
(which
isvery
possible,)
this
inference
would
there
appear
as
natural
andirrefragable
as
that
which
in
our
planet
ascribes
the
origin
of
allthings
to
design
and
intelligence,
as
explained
by
CLEANTHES.
Why
anorderly
system
may
not
be
spun
from
the
belly
as
well
as
from
the
brain,it
will
be
difficult
for
him
to
give
a
satisfactory
reason.I
must
confess,
PHILO,
replied
CLEANTHES,
that
of
all
men
living,
thetask
which
you
have
undertaken,
of
raising
doubts
and
objections,
suitsyou
best,
and
seems,
in
a
manner,
natural
and
unavoidable
to
you.
Sogreat
is
your
fertility
of
invention,
that
I
am
not
ashamed
toacknowledge
myself
unable,
on
a
sudden,
to
solve
regularly
suchout-of-the-way
difficulties
as
you
incessantly
start
upon
me:
though
Iclearly
see,
in
general,
their
fallacy
and
error.
And
I
question
not,
butyou
are
yourself,
at
present,
in
the
same
case,
and
have
not
the
solutionso
ready
as
the
objection:
while
you
must
be
sensible,
that
common
senseand
reason
are
entirely
against
you;
and
that
such
whimsies
as
you
havedelivered,
may
puzzle,
but
never
can
convince
us.PART
8What
you
ascribe
to
the
fertility
of
my
invention,
replied
PHILO,
isentirely
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
subject.
In
subjects
adapted
to
thenarrow
compass
of
human
reason,
there
is
commonly
but
one
determination,which
carries
probability
or
conviction
with
it;
and
to
a
man
of
soundjudgement,
all
other
suppositions,
but
that
one,
appear
entirely
absurdand
chimerical.
But
in
such
questions
as
the
present,
a
hundredcontradictory
views
may
preserve
a
kind
of
imperfect
analogy;
andinvention
has
here
full
scope
to
exert
itself.
Without
any
great
effortof
thought,
I
believe
that
I
could,
in
an
instant,
propose
other
systemsof
cosmogony,
which
would
have
some
faint
appearance
of
truth,
though
itis
a
thousand,
a
million
to
one,
if
either
yours
or
any
one
of
mine
bethe
true
system.For
instance,
what
if
I
should
revive
the
old
EPICUREAN
hypothesis?
Thisis
commonly,
and
I
believe
justly,
esteemed
the
most
absurd
system
thathas
yet
been
proposed;
yet
I
know
not
whether,
with
a
few
alterations,
itmight
not
be
brought
to
bear
a
faint
appearance
of
probability.
Insteadof
supposing
matter
infinite,
as
EPICURUS
did,
let
us
suppose
it
finite.A
finite
number
of
particles
is
only
susceptible
of
finite
transpositions:and
it
must
happen,
in
an
eternal
duration,
that
every
possible
order
orposition
must
be
tried
an
infinite
number
of
times.
This
world,
therefore,with
all
its
events,
even
the
most
minute,
has
before
been
produced
anddestroyed,
and
will
again
be
produced
and
destroyed,
without
any
boundsand
limitations.
No
one,
who
has
a
conception
of
the
powers
of
infinite,in
comparison
of
finite,
will
ever
scruple
this
determination.But
this
supposes,
said
DEMEA,
that
matter
can
acquire
motion,
withoutany
voluntary
agent
or
first
mover.And
where
is
the
difficulty,
replied
PHILO,
of
that
supposition?
Everyevent,
before
experience,
is
equally
difficult
and
incomprehensible;
andevery
event,
after
experience,
is
equally
easy
and
intelligible.
Motion,in
many
instances,
from
gravity,
from
elasticity,
from
electricity,begins
in
matter,
without
any
known
voluntary
agent:
and
to
supposealways,
in
these
cases,
an
unknown
voluntary
agent,
is
mere
hypothesis;and
hypothesis
attended
with
no
advantages.
The
beginning
of
motion
inmatter
itself
is
as
conceivable
a
priori
as
its
communication
from
mindand
intelligence.Besides,
why
may
not
motion
have
been
propagated
by
impulse
through
alleternity,
and
the
same
stock
of
it,
or
nearly
the
same,
be
still
upheldin
the
universe?
As
much
is
lost
by
the
composition
of
motion,
as
much
isgained
by
its
resolution.
And
whatever
the
causes
are,
the
fact
iscertain,
that
matter
is,
and
always
has
been,
in
continual
agitation,
asfar
as
human
experience
or
tradition
reaches.
There
is
not
probably,
atpresent,
in
the
whole
universe,
one
particle
of
matter
at
absolute
rest.And
this
very
consideration
too,
continued
PHILO,
which
we
have
stumbledon
in
the
course
of
the
argument,
suggests
a
new
hypothesis
of
cosmogony,that
is
not
absolutely
absurd
and
improbable.
Is
there
a
system,
anorder,
an
economy
of
things,
by
which
matter
can
preserve
that
perpetualagitation
which
seems
essential
to
it,
and
yet
maintain
a
constancy
inthe
forms
which
it
produces?
There
certainly
is
such
an
economy;
for
thisis
actually
the
case
with
the
present
world.
The
continual
motion
ofmatter,
therefore,
in
less
than
infinite
transpositions,
must
producethis
economy
or
order;
and
by
its
very
nature,
that
order,
when
onceestablished,
supports
itself,
for
many
ages,
if
not
to
eternity.
Butwherever
matter
is
so
poised,
arranged,
and
adjusted,
as
to
continue
inperpetual
motion,
and
yet
preserve
a
constancy
in
the
forms,
itssituation
must,
of
necessity,
have
all
the
same
appearance
of
art
andcontrivance
which
we
observe
at
present.
All
the
parts
of
each
form
musthave
a
relation
to
each
other,
and
to
the
whole;
and
the
whole
itselfmust
have
a
relation
to
the
other
parts
of
the
universe;
to
the
elementin
which
the
form
subsists;
to
the
materials
with
which
it
repairs
itswaste
and
decay;
and
to
every
other
form
which
is
hostile
or
friendly.
Adefect
in
any
of
these
particulars
destroys
the
form;
and
the
matter
ofwhich
it
is
composed
is
again
set
loose,
and
is
thrown
into
irregularmotions
and
fermentations,
till
it
unite
itself
to
some
other
regularform.
If
no
such
form
be
prepared
to
receive
it,
and
if
there
be
a
greatquantity
of
this
corrupted
matter
in
the
universe,
the
universe
itself
isentirely
disordered;
whether
it
be
the
feeble
embryo
of
a
world
in
itsfirst
beginnings
that
is
thus
destroyed,
or
the
rotten
carcass
of
onelanguishing
in
old
age
and
infirmity.
In
either
case,
a
chaos
ensues;till
finite,
though
innumerable
revolutions
produce
at
last
some
forms,whose
parts
and
organs
are
so
adjusted
as
to
support
the
forms
amidst
acontinued
succession
of
matter.Suppose
(for
we
shall
endeavour
to
vary
the
expression),
that
matter
werethrown
into
any
position,
by
a
blind,
unguided
force;
it
is
evident
thatthis
first
position
must,
in
all
probability,
be
the
most
confused
andmost
disorderly
imaginable,
without
any
resemblance
to
those
works
ofhuman
contrivance,
which,
along
with
a
symmetry
of
parts,
discover
anadjustment
of
means
to
ends,
and
a
tendency
to
self-preservation.
If
theactuating
force
cease
after
this
operation,
matter
must
remain
for
everin
disorder,
and
continue
an
immense
chaos,
without
any
proportion
oractivity.
But
suppose
that
the
actuating
force,
whatever
it
be,
stillcontinues
in
matter,
this
first
position
will
immediately
give
place
to
asecond,
which
will
likewise
in
all
probability
be
as
disorderly
as
thefirst,
and
so
on
through
many
successions
of
changes
and
revolutions.
Noparticular
order
or
position
ever
continues
a
moment
unaltered.
Theoriginal
force,
still
remaining
in
activity,
gives
a
perpetualrestlessness
to
matter.
Every
possible
situation
is
produced,
andinstantly
destroyed.
If
a
glimpse
or
dawn
of
order
appears
for
a
moment,it
is
instantly
hurried
away,
and
confounded,
by
that
never-ceasing
forcewhich
actuates
every
part
of
matter.Thus
the
universe
goes
on
for
many
ages
in
a
continued
succession
ofchaos
and
disorder.
But
is
it
not
possible
that
it
may
settle
at
last,
soas
not
to
lose
its
motion
and
active
force
(for
that
we
have
supposedinherent
in
it),
yet
so
as
to
preserve
an
uniformity
of
appearance,amidst
the
continual
motion
and
fluctuation
of
its
parts?
This
we
find
tobe
the
case
with
the
universe
at
present.
Every
individual
is
perpetuallychanging,
and
every
part
of
every
individual;
and
yet
the
whole
remains,in
appearance,
the
same.
May
we
not
hope
for
such
a
position,
or
ratherbe
assured
of
it,
from
the
eternal
revolutions
of
unguided
matter;
andmay
not
this
account
for
all
the
appearing
wisdom
and
contrivance
whichis
in
the
universe?
Let
us
contemplate
the
subject
a
little,
and
we
shallfind,
that
this
adjustment,
if
attained
by
matter
of
a
seeming
stabilityin
the
forms,
with
a
real
and
perpetual
revolution
or
motion
of
parts,affords
a
plausible,
if
not
a
true
solution
of
the
difficulty.It
is
in
vain,
therefore,
to
insist
upon
the
uses
of
the
parts
in
animalsor
vegetables,
and
their
curious
adjustment
to
each
other.
I
would
fainknow,
how
an
animal
could
subsist,
unless
its
parts
were
so
adjusted?
Dowe
not
find,
that
it
immediately
perishes
whenever
this
adjustmentceases,
and
that
its
matter
corrupting
tries
some
new
form?
It
happensindeed,
that
the
parts
of
the
world
are
so
well
adjusted,
that
someregular
form
immediately
lays
claim
to
this
corrupted
matter:
and
if
itwere
not
so,
could
the
world
subsist?
Must
it
not
dissolve
as
well
as
theanimal,
and
pass
through
new
positions
and
situations,
till
in
great,
butfinite
succession,
it
falls
at
last
into
the
present
or
some
such
order?It
is
well,
replied
CLEANTHES,
you
told
us,
that
this
hypothesis
wassuggested
on
a
sudden,
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
Had
you
had
leisureto
examine
it,
you
would
soon
have
perceived
the
insuperable
objectionsto
which
it
is
exposed.
No
form,
you
say,
can
subsist,
unless
it
possessthose
powers
and
organs
requisite
for
its
subsistence:
some
new
order
oreconomy
must
be
tried,
and
so
on,
without
intermission;
till
at
last
someorder,
which
can
support
and
maintain
itself,
is
fallen
upon.
Butaccording
to
this
hypothesis,
whence
arise
the
many
conveniences
andadvantages
which
men
and
all
animals
possess?
Two
eyes,
two
ears,
are
notabsolutely
necessary
for
the
subsistence
of
the
species.
Human
race
mighthave
been
propagated
and
preserved,
without
horses,
dogs,
cows,
sheep,and
those
innumerable
fruits
and
products
which
serve
to
our
satisfactionand
enjoyment.
If
no
camels
had
been
created
for
the
use
of
man
in
thesandy
deserts
of
AFRICA
and
ARABIA,
would
the
world
have
been
dissolved?If
no
lodestone
had
been
framed
to
give
that
wonderful
and
usefuldirection
to
the
needle,
would
human
society
and
the
human
kind
have
beenimmediately
extinguished?
Though
the
maxims
of
Nature
be
in
general
veryfrugal,
yet
instances
of
this
kind
are
far
from
being
rare;
and
any
oneof
them
is
a
sufficient
proof
of
design,
and
of
a
benevolent
design,which
gave
rise
to
the
order
and
arrangement
of
the
universe.At
least,
you
may
safely
infer,
said
PHILO,
that
the
foregoing
hypothesisis
so
far
incomplete
and
imperfect,
which
I
shall
not
scruple
to
allow.But
can
we
ever
reasonably
expect
greater
success
in
any
attempts
of
thisnature?
Or
can
we
ever
hope
to
erect
a
system
of
cosmogony,
that
will
beliable
to
no
exceptions,
and
will
contain
no
circumstance
repugnant
toour
limited
and
imperfect
experience
of
the
analogy
of
Nature?
Yourtheory
itself
cannot
surely
pretend
to
any
such
advantage,
even
thoughyou
have
run
into
Anthropomorphism,
the
better
to
preserve
a
conformityto
common
experience.
Let
us
once
more
put
it
to
trial.
In
all
instanceswhich
we
have
ever
seen,
ideas
are
copied
from
real
objects,
and
areectypal,
not
archetypal,
to
express
myself
in
learned
terms:
You
reversethis
order,
and
give
thought
the
precedence.
In
all
instances
which
wehave
ever
seen,
thought
has
no
influence
upon
matter,
except
where
thatmatter
is
so
conjoined
with
it
as
to
have
an
equal
reciprocal
influenceupon
it.
No
animal
can
move
immediately
any
thing
but
the
members
of
itsown
body;
and
indeed,
the
equality
of
action
and
reaction
seems
to
be
anuniversal
law
of
nature:
But
your
theory
implies
a
contradiction
to
thisexperience.
These
instances,
with
many
more,
which
it
were
easy
tocollect,
(particularly
the
supposition
of
a
mind
or
system
of
thoughtthat
is
eternal,
or,
in
other
words,
an
animal
ingenerable
and
immortal);these
instances,
I
say,
may
teach
all
of
us
sobriety
in
condemning
eachother,
and
let
us
see,
that
as
no
system
of
this
kind
ought
ever
to
bereceived
from
a
slight
analogy,
so
neither
ought
any
to
be
rejected
onaccount
of
a
small
incongruity.
For
that
is
an
inconvenience
from
whichwe
can
justly
pronounce
no
one
to
be
exempted.All
religious
systems,
it
is
confessed,
are
subject
to
great
andinsuperable
difficulties.
Each
disputant
triumphs
in
his
turn;
while
hecarries
on
an
offensive
war,
and
exposes
the
absurdities,
barbarities,and
pernicious
tenets
of
his
antagonist.
But
all
of
them,
on
the
whole,prepare
a
complete
triumph
for
the
Sceptic;
who
tells
them,
that
nosystem
ought
ever
to
be
embraced
with
regard
to
such
subjects:
For
thisplain
reason,
that
no
absurdity
ought
ever
to
be
assented
to
with
regardto
any
subject.
A
total
suspense
of
judgement
is
here
our
only
reasonableresource.
And
if
every
attack,
as
is
commonly
observed,
and
no
defence,among
Theologians,
is
successful;
how
complete
must
be
his
victory,
whoremains
always,
with
all
mankind,
on
the
offensive,
and
has
himself
nofixed
station
or
abiding
city,
which
he
is
ever,
on
any
occasion,
obligedto
defend?PART
9But
if
so
many
difficulties
attend
the
argument
a
posteriori,
said
DEMEA,had
we
not
better
adhere
to
that
simple
and
sublime
argument
a
priori,which,
by
offering
to
us
infallible
demonstration,
cuts
off
at
once
alldoubt
and
difficulty?
By
this
argument,
too,
we
may
prove
the
infinity
ofthe
Divine
attributes,
which,
I
am
afraid,
can
never
be
ascertained
withcertainty
from
any
other
topic.
For
how
can
an
effect,
which
either
isfinite,
or,
for
aught
we
know,
may
be
so;
how
can
such
an
effect,
I
say,prove
an
infinite
cause?
The
unity
too
of
the
Divine
Nature,
it
is
verydifficult,
if
not
absolutely
impossible,
to
deduce
merely
fromcontemplating
the
works
of
nature;
nor
will
the
uniformity
alone
of
theplan,
even
were
it
allowed,
give
us
any
assurance
of
that
attribute.Whereas
the
argument
a
priori
...You
seem
to
reason,
DEMEA,
interposed
CLEANTHES,
as
if
those
advantagesand
conveniences
in
the
abstract
argument
were
full
proofs
of
itssolidity.
But
it
is
first
proper,
in
my
opinion,
to
determine
whatargument
of
this
nature
you
choose
to
insist
on;
and
we
shall
afterwards,from
itself,
better
than
from
its
useful
consequences,
endeavour
todetermine
what
value
we
ought
to
put
upon
it.The
argument,
replied
DEMEA,
which
I
would
insist
on,
is
the
common
one.Whatever
exists
must
have
a
cause
or
reason
of
its
existence;
it
beingabsolutely
impossible
for
any
thing
to
produce
itself,
or
be
the
cause
ofits
own
existence.
In
mounting
up,
therefore,
from
effects
to
causes,
wemust
either
go
on
in
tracing
an
infinite
succession,
without
any
ultimatecause
at
all;
or
must
at
last
have
recourse
to
some
ultimate
cause,
thatis
necessarily
existent:
Now,
that
the
first
supposition
is
absurd,
maybe
thus
proved.
In
the
infinite
chain
or
succession
of
causes
andeffects,
each
single
effect
is
determined
to
exist
by
the
power
andefficacy
of
that
cause
which
immediately
preceded;
but
the
whole
eternalchain
or
succession,
taken
together,
is
not
determined
or
caused
by
anything;
and
yet
it
is
evident
that
it
requires
a
cause
or
reason,
as
muchas
any
particular
object
which
begins
to
exist
in
time.
The
question
isstill
reasonable,
why
this
particular
succession
of
causes
existed
frometernity,
and
not
any
other
succession,
or
no
succession
at
all.
If
therebe
no
necessarily
existent
being,
any
supposition
which
can
be
formed
isequally
possible;
nor
is
there
any
more
absurdity
in
Nothing's
havingexisted
from
eternity,
than
there
is
in
that
succession
of
causes
whichconstitutes
the
universe.
What
was
it,
then,
which
determined
Somethingto
exist
rather
than
Nothing,
and
bestowed
being
on
a
particularpossibility,
exclusive
of
the
rest?
External
causes,
there
are
supposedto
be
none.
Chance
is
a
word
without
a
meaning.
Was
it
Nothing?
But
thatcan
never
produce
any
thing.
We
must,
therefore,
have
recourse
to
anecessarily
existent
Being,
who
carries
the
REASON
of
his
existence
inhimself,
and
who
cannot
be
supposed
not
to
exist,
without
an
expresscontradiction.
There
is,
consequently,
such
a
Being;
that
is,
there
is
aDeity.I
shall
not
leave
it
to
PHILO,
said
CLEANTHES,
though
I
know
that
thestarting
objections
is
his
chief
delight,
to
point
out
the
weakness
ofthis
metaphysical
reasoning.
It
seems
to
me
so
obviously
ill-grounded,and
at
the
same
time
of
so
little
consequence
to
the
cause
of
true
pietyand
religion,
that
I
shall
myself
venture
to
show
the
fallacy
of
it.I
shall
begin
with
observing,
that
there
is
an
evident
absurdity
inpretending
to
demonstrate
a
matter
of
fact,
or
to
prove
it
by
anyarguments
a
priori.
Nothing
is
demonstrable,
unless
the
contrary
impliesa
contradiction.
Nothing,
that
is
distinctly
conceivable,
implies
acontradiction.
Whatever
we
conceive
as
existent,
we
can
also
conceive
asnon-existent.
There
is
no
being,
therefore,
whose
non-existence
implies
acontradiction.
Consequently
there
is
no
being,
whose
existence
isdemonstrable.
I
propose
this
argument
as
entirely
decisive,
and
amwilling
to
rest
the
whole
controversy
upon
it.It
is
pretended
that
the
Deity
is
a
necessarily
existent
being;
and
thisnecessity
of
his
existence
is
attempted
to
be
explained
by
asserting,that
if
we
knew
his
whole
essence
or
nature,
we
should
perceive
it
to
beas
impossible
for
him
not
to
exist,
as
for
twice
two
not
to
be
four.
Butit
is
evident
that
this
can
never
happen,
while
our
faculties
remain
thesame
as
at
present.
It
will
still
be
possible
for
us,
at
any
time,
toconceive
the
non-existence
of
what
we
formerly
conceived
to
exist;
norcan
the
mind
ever
lie
under
a
necessity
of
supposing
any
object
to
remainalways
in
being;
in
the
same
manner
as
we
lie
under
a
necessity
of
alwaysconceiving
twice
two
to
be
four.
The
words,
therefore,
necessaryexistence,
have
no
meaning;
or,
which
is
the
same
thing,
none
that
isconsistent.But
further,
why
may
not
the
material
universe
be
the
necessarilyexistent
Being,
according
to
this
pretended
explication
of
necessity?
Wedare
not
affirm
that
we
know
all
the
qualities
of
matter;
and
for
aughtwe
can
determine,
it
may
contain
some
qualities,
which,
were
they
known,would
make
its
non-existence
appear
as
great
a
contradiction
as
thattwice
two
is
five.
I
find
only
one
argument
employed
to
prove,
that
thematerial
world
is
not
the
necessarily
existent
Being:
and
this
argumentis
derived
from
the
contingency
both
of
the
matter
and
the
form
of
theworld.
"Any
particle
of
matter,"
it
is
said[]Dr.
Clarke,
"may
be
conceivedto
be
annihilated;
and
any
form
may
be
conceived
to
be
altered.
Such
anannihilation
or
alteration,
therefore,
is
not
impossible."
But
it
seemsa
great
partiality
not
to
perceive,
that
the
same
argument
extendsequally
to
the
Deity,
so
far
as
we
have
any
conception
of
him;
and
thatthe
mind
can
at
least
imagine
him
to
be
non-existent,
or
his
attributesto
be
altered.
It
must
be
some
unknown,
inconceivable
qualities,
whichcan
make
his
non-existence
appear
impossible,
or
his
attributesunalterable:
And
no
reason
can
be
assigned,
why
these
qualities
may
notbelong
to
matter.
As
they
are
altogether
unknown
and
inconceivable,
theycan
never
be
proved
incompatible
with
it.Add
to
this,
that
in
tracing
an
eternal
succession
of
objects,
it
seemsabsurd
to
inquire
for
a
general
cause
or
first
author.
How
can
any
thing,that
exists
from
eternity,
have
a
cause,
since
that
relation
implies
apriority
in
time,
and
a
beginning
of
existence?In
such
a
chain,
too,
or
succession
of
objects,
each
part
is
caused
bythat
which
preceded
it,
and
causes
that
which
succeeds
it.
Where
then
isthe
difficulty?
But
the
whole,
you
say,
wants
a
cause.
I
answer,
that
theuniting
of
these
parts
into
a
whole,
like
the
uniting
of
several
distinctcountries
into
one
kingdom,
or
several
distinct
members
into
one
body,
isperformed
merely
by
an
arbitrary
act
of
the
mind,
and
has
no
influence
onthe
nature
of
things.
Did
I
show
you
the
particular
causes
of
eachindividual
in
a
collection
of
twenty
particles
of
matter,
I
should
thinkit
very
unreasonable,
should
you
afterwards
ask
me,
what
was
the
cause
ofthe
whole
twenty.
This
is
sufficiently
explained
in
explaining
the
causeof
the
parts.Though
the
reasonings
which
you
have
urged,
CLEANTHES,
may
well
excuseme,
said
PHILO,
from
starting
any
further
difficulties,
yet
I
cannotforbear
insisting
still
upon
another
topic.
It
is
observed
byarithmeticians,
that
the
products
of
9,
compose
always
either
9,
or
somelesser
product
of
9,
if
you
add
together
all
the
characters
of
which
anyof
the
former
products
is
composed.
Thus,
of
18,
27,
36,
which
areproducts
of
9,
you
make
9
by
adding
1
to
8,
2
to
7,
3
to
6.
Thus,
369
isa
product
also
of
9;
and
if
you
add
3,
6,
and
9,
you
make
18,
a
lesserproduct
of
9.
To
a
superficial
observer,
so
wonderful
a
regularity
maybe
admired
as
the
effect
either
of
chance
or
design:
but
a
skilfulalgebraist
immediately
concludes
it
to
be
the
work
of
necessity,
anddemonstrates,
that
it
must
for
ever
result
from
the
nature
of
thesenumbers.
Is
it
not
probable,
I
ask,
that
the
whole
economy
of
theuniverse
is
conducted
by
a
like
necessity,
though
no
human
algebra
canfurnish
a
key
which
solves
the
difficulty?
And
instead
of
admiring
theorder
of
natural
beings,
may
it
not
happen,
that,
could
we
penetrate
intothe
intimate
nature
of
bodies,
we
should
clearly
see
why
it
wasabsolutely
impossible
they
could
ever
admit
of
any
other
disposition?
Sodangerous
is
it
to
introduce
this
idea
of
necessity
into
the
presentquestion!
and
so
naturally
does
it
afford
an
inference
directly
oppositeto
the
religious
hypothesis!But
dropping
all
these
abstractions,
continued
PHILO,
and
confiningourselves
to
more
familiar
topics,
I
shall
venture
to
add
an
observation,that
the
argument
a
priori
has
seldom
been
found
very
convincing,
exceptto
people
of
a
metaphysical
head,
who
have
accustomed
themselves
toabstract
reasoning,
and
who,
finding
from
mathematics,
that
theunderstanding
frequently
leads
to
truth
through
obscurity,
and,
contraryto
first
appearances,
have
transferred
the
same
habit
of
thinking
tosubjects
where
it
ought
not
to
have
place.
Other
people,
even
of
goodsense
and
the
best
inclined
to
religion,
feel
always
some
deficiency
insuch
arguments,
though
they
are
not
perhaps
able
to
explain
distinctlywhere
it
lies;
a
certain
proof
that
men
ever
did,
and
ever
will
derivetheir
religion
from
other
sources
than
from
this
species
of
reasoning.PART
10It
is
my
opinion,
I
own,
replied
DEMEA,
that
each
man
feels,
in
a
manner,the
truth
of
religion
within
his
own
breast,
and,
from
a
consciousness
ofhis
imbecility
and
misery,
rather
than
from
any
reasoning,
is
led
to
seekprotection
from
that
Being,
on
whom
he
and
all
nature
is
dependent.
Soanxious
or
so
tedious
are
even
the
best
scenes
of
life,
that
futurity
isstill
the
object
of
all
our
hopes
and
fears.
We
incessantly
look
forward,and
endeavour,
by
prayers,
adoration,
and
sacrifice,
to
appease
thoseunknown
powers,
whom
we
find,
by
experience,
so
able
to
afflict
andoppress
us.
Wretched
creatures
that
we
are!
what
resource
for
us
amidstthe
innumerable
ills
of
life,
did
not
religion
suggest
some
methods
ofatonement,
and
appease
those
terrors
with
which
we
are
incessantlyagitated
and
tormented?I
am
indeed
persuaded,
said
PHILO,
that
the
best,
and
indeed
the
onlymethod
of
bringing
every
one
to
a
due
sense
of
religion,
is
by
justrepresentations
of
the
misery
and
wickedness
of
men.
And
for
that
purposea
talent
of
eloquence
and
strong
imagery
is
more
requisite
than
that
ofreasoning
and
argument.
For
is
it
necessary
to
prove
what
every
one
feelswithin
himself?
It
is
only
necessary
to
make
us
feel
it,
if
possible,more
intimately
and
sensibly.The
people,
indeed,
replied
DEMEA,
are
sufficiently
convinced
of
thisgreat
and
melancholy
truth.
The
miseries
of
life;
the
unhappiness
of
man;the
general
corruptions
of
our
nature;
the
unsatisfactory
enjoyment
ofpleasures,
riches,
honours;
these
phrases
have
become
almost
proverbialin
all
languages.
And
who
can
doubt
of
what
all
men
declare
from
theirown
immediate
feeling
and
experience?In
this
point,
said
PHILO,
the
learned
are
perfectly
agreed
with
thevulgar;
and
in
all
letters,
sacred
and
profane,
the
topic
of
human
miseryhas
been
insisted
on
with
the
most
pathetic
eloquence
that
sorrow
andmelancholy
could
inspire.
The
poets,
who
speak
from
sentiment,
without
asystem,
and
whose
testimony
has
therefore
the
more
authority,
abound
inimages
of
this
nature.
From
Homer
down
to
Dr.
Young,
the
whole
inspiredtribe
have
ever
been
sensible,
that
no
other
representation
of
thingswould
suit
the
feeling
and
observation
of
each
individual.As
to
authorities,
replied
DEMEA,
you
need
not
seek
them.
Look
round
thislibrary
of
CLEANTHES.
I
shall
venture
to
affirm,
that,
except
authors
ofparticular
sciences,
such
as
chemistry
or
botany,
who
have
no
occasion
totreat
of
human
life,
there
is
scarce
one
of
those
innumerable
writers,from
whom
the
sense
of
human
misery
has
not,
in
some
passage
or
other,extorted
a
complaint
and
confession
of
it.
At
least,
the
chance
isentirely
on
that
side;
and
no
one
author
has
ever,
so
far
as
I
canrecollect,
been
so
extravagant
as
to
deny
it.There
you
must
excuse
me,
said
PHILO:
LEIBNIZ
has
denied
it;
and
isperhaps
the
first
[That
sentiment
had
been
maintained
by
Dr.
King
and
somefew
others
before
Leibniz;
though
by
none
of
so
great
a
fame
as
thatGerman
philosopher]
who
ventured
upon
so
bold
and
paradoxical
an
opinion;at
least,
the
first
who
made
it
essential
to
his
philosophical
system.And
by
being
the
first,
replied
DEMEA,
might
he
not
have
been
sensible
ofhis
error?
For
is
this
a
subject
in
which
philosophers
can
propose
tomake
discoveries
especially
in
so
late
an
age?
And
can
any
man
hope
by
asimple
denial
(for
the
subject
scarcely
admits
of
reasoning),
to
beardown
the
united
testimony
of
mankind,
founded
on
sense
and
consciousness?And
why
should
man,
added
he,
pretend
to
an
exemption
from
the
lot
of
allother
animals?
The
whole
earth,
believe
me,
PHILO,
is
cursed
andpolluted.
A
perpetual
war
is
kindled
amongst
all
living
creatures.Necessity,
hunger,
want,
stimulate
the
strong
and
courageous:
Fear,anxiety,
terror,
agitate
the
weak
and
infirm.
The
first
entrance
intolife
gives
anguish
to
the
new-born
infant
and
to
its
wretched
parent:Weakness,
impotence,
distress,
attend
each
stage
of
that
life:
and
it
isat
last
finished
in
agony
and
horror.Observe
too,
says
PHILO,
the
curious
artifices
of
Nature,
in
order
toembitter
the
life
of
every
living
being.
The
stronger
prey
upon
theweaker,
and
keep
them
in
perpetual
terror
and
anxiety.
The
weaker
too,
intheir
turn,
often
prey
upon
the
stronger,
and
vex
and
molest
them
withoutrelaxation.
Consider
that
innumerable
race
of
insects,
which
either
arebred
on
the
body
of
each
animal,
or,
flying
about,
infix
their
stings
inhim.
These
insects
have
others
still
less
than
themselves,
which
tormentthem.
And
thus
on
each
hand,
before
and
behind,
above
and
below,
everyanimal
is
surrounded
with
enemies,
which
incessantly
seek
his
misery
anddestruction.Man
alone,
said
DEMEA,
seems
to
be,
in
part,
an
exception
to
this
rule.For
by
combination
in
society,
he
can
easily
master
lions,
tigers,
andbears,
whose
greater
strength
and
agility
naturally
enable
them
to
preyupon
him.On
the
contrary,
it
is
here
chiefly,
cried
PHILO,
that
the
uniform
andequal
maxims
of
Nature
are
most
apparent.
Man,
it
is
true,
can,
bycombination,
surmount
all
his
real
enemies,
and
become
master
of
thewhole
animal
creation:
but
does
he
not
immediately
raise
up
to
himselfimaginary
enemies,
the
demons
of
his
fancy,
who
haunt
him
withsuperstitious
terrors,
and
blast
every
enjoyment
of
life?
His
pleasure,as
he
imagines,
becomes,
in
their
eyes,
a
crime:
his
food
and
repose
givethem
umbrage
and
offence:
his
very
sleep
and
dreams
furnish
new
materialsto
anxious
fear:
and
even
death,
his
refuge
from
every
other
ill,presents
only
the
dread
of
endless
and
innumerable
woes.
Nor
does
thewolf
molest
more
the
timid
flock,
than
superstition
does
the
anxiousbreast
of
wretched
mortals.Besides,
consider,
DEMEA:
This
very
society,
by
which
we
surmount
thosewild
beasts,
our
natural
enemies;
what
new
enemies
does
it
not
raise
tous?
What
woe
and
misery
does
it
not
occasion?
Man
is
the
greatest
enemyof
man.
Oppression,
injustice,
contempt,
contumely,
violence,
sedition,war,
calumny,
treachery,
fraud;
by
these
they
mutually
torment
eachother;
and
they
would
soon
dissolve
that
society
which
they
had
formed,were
it
not
for
the
dread
of
still
greater
ills,
which
must
attend
theirseparation.But
though
these
external
insults,
said
DEMEA,
from
animals,
from
men,from
all
the
elements,
which
assault
us,
form
a
frightful
catalogue
ofwoes,
they
are
nothing
in
comparison
of
those
which
arise
withinourselves,
from
the
distempered
condition
of
our
mind
and
body.
How
manylie
under
the
lingering
torment
of
diseases?
Hear
the
patheticenumeration
of
the
great
poet.
Intestine
stone
and
ulcer,
colic-pangs,
Demoniac
frenzy,
moping
melancholy,
And
moon-struck
madness,
pining
atrophy,
Marasmus,
and
wide-wasting
pestilence.
Dire
was
the
tossing,
deep
the
groans:
despair
Tended
the
sick,
busiest
from
couch
to
couch.
And
over
them
triumphant
death
his
dart
Shook:
but
delay'd
to
strike,
though
oft
invok'd
With
vows,
as
their
chief
good
and
final
hope.The
disorders
of
the
mind,
continued
DEMEA,
though
more
secret,
are
notperhaps
less
dismal
and
vexatious.
Remorse,
shame,
anguish,
rage,disappointment,
anxiety,
fear,
dejection,
despair;
who
has
ever
passedthrough
life
without
cruel
inroads
from
these
tormentors?
How
many
havescarcely
ever
felt
any
better
sensations?
Labour
and
poverty,
so
abhorredby
every
one,
are
the
certain
lot
of
the
far
greater
number;
and
thosefew
privileged
persons,
who
enjoy
ease
and
opulence,
never
reachcontentment
or
true
felicity.
All
the
goods
of
life
united
would
not
makea
very
happy
man;
but
all
the
ills
united
would
make
a
wretch
indeed;
andany
one
of
them
almost
(and
who
can
be
free
from
every
one?)
nay
oftenthe
absence
of
one
good
(and
who
can
possess
all?)
is
sufficient
torender
life
ineligible.Were
a
stranger
to
drop
on
a
sudden
into
this
world,
I
would
show
him,
asa
specimen
of
its
ills,
a
hospital
full
of
diseases,
a
prison
crowdedwith
malefactors
and
debtors,
a
field
of
battle
strewed
with
carcasses,
afleet
foundering
in
the
ocean,
a
nation
languishing
under
tyranny,famine,
or
pestilence.
To
turn
the
gay
side
of
life
to
him,
and
give
hima
notion
of
its
pleasures;
whither
should
I
conduct
him?
to
a
ball,
to
anopera,
to
court?
He
might
justly
think,
that
I
was
only
showing
him
adiversity
of
distress
and
sorrow.There
is
no
evading
such
striking
instances,
said
PHILO,
but
byapologies,
which
still
further
aggravate
the
charge.
Why
have
all
men,
Iask,
in
all
ages,
complained
incessantly
of
the
miseries
of
life?...They
have
no
just
reason,
says
one:
these
complaints
proceed
only
fromtheir
discontented,
repining,
anxious
disposition...And
can
therepossibly,
I
reply,
be
a
more
certain
foundation
of
misery,
than
such
awretched
temper?But
if
they
were
really
as
unhappy
as
they
pretend,
says
my
antagonist,why
do
they
remain
in
life?...
Not
satisfied
with
life,
afraid
of
death.This
is
the
secret
chain,
say
I,
that
holds
us.
We
are
terrified,
notbribed
to
the
continuance
of
our
existence.It
is
only
a
false
delicacy,
he
may
insist,
which
a
few
refined
spiritsindulge,
and
which
has
spread
these
complaints
among
the
whole
race
ofmankind.
.
.
.
And
what
is
this
delicacy,
I
ask,
which
you
blame?
Is
itany
thing
but
a
greater
sensibility
to
all
the
pleasures
and
pains
oflife?
and
if
the
man
of
a
delicate,
refined
temper,
by
being
so
much
morealive
than
the
rest
of
the
world,
is
only
so
much
more
unhappy,
whatjudgement
must
we
form
in
general
of
human
life?Let
men
remain
at
rest,
says
our
adversary,
and
they
will
be
easy.
Theyare
willing
artificers
of
their
own
misery.
.
.
.
No!
reply
I:
an
anxiouslanguor
follows
their
repose;
disappointment,
vexation,
trouble,
theiractivity
and
ambition.I
can
observe
something
like
what
you
mention
in
some
others,
repliedCLEANTHES:
but
I
confess
I
feel
little
or
nothing
of
it
in
myself,
andhope
that
it
is
not
so
common
as
you
represent
it.If
you
feel
not
human
misery
yourself,
cried
DEMEA,
I
congratulate
you
onso
happy
a
singularity.
Others,
seemingly
the
most
prosperous,
have
notbeen
ashamed
to
vent
their
complaints
in
the
most
melancholy
strains.
Letus
attend
to
the
great,
the
fortunate
emperor,
CHARLES
V,
when,
tiredwith
human
grandeur,
he
resigned
all
his
extensive
dominions
into
thehands
of
his
son.
In
the
last
harangue
which
he
made
on
that
memorableoccasion,
he
publicly
avowed,
that
the
greatest
prosperities
which
he
hadever
enjoyed,
had
been
mixed
with
so
many
adversities,
that
he
mighttruly
say
he
had
never
enjoyed
any
satisfaction
or
contentment.
But
didthe
retired
life,
in
which
he
sought
for
shelter,
afford
him
any
greaterhappiness?
If
we
may
credit
his
son's
account,
his
repentance
commencedthe
very
day
of
his
resignation.CICERO's
fortune,
from
small
beginnings,
rose
to
the
greatest
lustre
andrenown;
yet
what
pathetic
complaints
of
the
ills
of
life
do
his
familiarletters,
as
well
as
philosophical
discourses,
contain?
And
suitably
tohis
own
experience,
he
introduces
CATO,
the
great,
the
fortunate
CATO,protesting
in
his
old
age,
that
had
he
a
new
life
in
his
offer,
he
wouldreject
the
present.Ask
yourself,
ask
any
of
your
acquaintance,
whether
they
would
live
overagain
the
last
ten
or
twenty
years
of
their
life.
No!
but
the
nexttwenty,
they
say,
will
be
better:
And
from
the
dregs
of
life,
hope
to
receive
What
the
first
sprightly
running
could
not
give.Thus
at
last
they
find
(such
is
the
greatness
of
human
misery,
itreconciles
even
contradictions),
that
they
complain
at
once
of
theshortness
of
life,
and
of
its
vanity
and
sorrow.And
is
it
possible,
CLEANTHES,
said
PHILO,
that
after
all
thesereflections,
and
infinitely
more,
which
might
be
suggested,
you
can
stillpersevere
in
your
Anthropomorphism,
and
assert
the
moral
attributes
ofthe
Deity,
his
justice,
benevolence,
mercy,
and
rectitude,
to
be
of
thesame
nature
with
these
virtues
in
human
creatures?
His
power
we
allow
isinfinite:
whatever
he
wills
is
executed:
but
neither
man
nor
any
otheranimal
is
happy:
therefore
he
does
not
will
their
happiness.
His
wisdomis
infinite:
He
is
never
mistaken
in
choosing
the
means
to
any
end:
Butthe
course
of
Nature
tends
not
to
human
or
animal
felicity:
therefore
itis
not
established
for
that
purpose.
Through
the
whole
compass
of
humanknowledge,
there
are
no
inferences
more
certain
and
infallible
thanthese.
In
what
respect,
then,
do
his
benevolence
and
mercy
resemble
thebenevolence
and
mercy
of
men?EPICURUS's
old
questions
are
yet
unanswered.
Is
he
willing
to
prevent
evil,but
not
able?
then
is
he
impotent.
Is
he
able,
but
not
willing?
then
is
hemalevolent.
Is
he
both
able
and
willing?
whence
then
is
evil?You
ascribe,
CLEANTHES
(and
I
believe
justly),
a
purpose
and
intention
toNature.
But
what,
I
beseech
you,
is
the
object
of
that
curious
artificeand
machinery,
which
she
has
displayed
in
all
animals?
The
preservationalone
of
individuals,
and
propagation
of
the
species.
It
seems
enough
forher
purpose,
if
such
a
rank
be
barely
upheld
in
the
universe,
without
anycare
or
concern
for
the
happiness
of
the
members
that
compose
it.
Noresource
for
this
purpose:
no
machinery,
in
order
merely
to
give
pleasureor
ease:
no
fund
of
pure
joy
and
contentment:
no
indulgence,
without
somewant
or
necessity
accompanying
it.
At
least,
the
few
phenomena
of
thisnature
are
overbalanced
by
opposite
phenomena
of
still
greater
importance.Our
sense
of
music,
harmony,
and
indeed
beauty
of
all
kinds,
givessatisfaction,
without
being
absolutely
necessary
to
the
preservation
andpropagation
of
the
species.
But
what
racking
pains,
on
the
other
hand,arise
from
gouts,
gravels,
megrims,
toothaches,
rheumatisms,
where
theinjury
to
the
animal
machinery
is
either
small
or
incurable?
Mirth,laughter,
play,
frolic,
seem
gratuitous
satisfactions,
which
have
nofurther
tendency:
spleen,
melancholy,
discontent,
superstition,
are
painsof
the
same
nature.
How
then
does
the
Divine
benevolence
display
itself,in
the
sense
of
you
Anthropomorphites?
None
but
we
Mystics,
as
you
werepleased
to
call
us,
can
account
for
this
strange
mixture
of
phenomena,
byderiving
it
from
attributes,
infinitely
perfect,
but
incomprehensible.And
have
you
at
last,
said
CLEANTHES
smiling,
betrayed
your
intentions,PHILO?
Your
long
agreement
with
DEMEA
did
indeed
a
little
surprise
me;but
I
find
you
were
all
the
while
erecting
a
concealed
battery
againstme.
And
I
must
confess,
that
you
have
now
fallen
upon
a
subject
worthy
ofyour
noble
spirit
of
opposition
and
controversy.
If
you
can
make
out
thepresent
point,
and
prove
mankind
to
be
unhappy
or
corrupted,
there
is
anend
at
once
of
all
religion.
For
to
what
purpose
establish
the
naturalattributes
of
the
Deity,
while
the
moral
are
still
doubtful
anduncertain?You
take
umbrage
very
easily,
replied
DEMEA,
at
opinions
the
mostinnocent,
and
the
most
generally
received,
even
amongst
the
religious
anddevout
themselves:
and
nothing
can
be
more
surprising
than
to
find
atopic
like
this,
concerning
the
wickedness
and
misery
of
man,
chargedwith
no
less
than
Atheism
and
profaneness.
Have
not
all
pious
divines
andpreachers,
who
have
indulged
their
rhetoric
on
so
fertile
a
subject;
havethey
not
easily,
I
say,
given
a
solution
of
any
difficulties
which
mayattend
it?
This
world
is
but
a
point
in
comparison
of
the
universe;
thislife
but
a
moment
in
comparison
of
eternity.
The
present
evil
phenomena,therefore,
are
rectified
in
other
regions,
and
in
some
future
period
ofexistence.
And
the
eyes
of
men,
being
then
opened
to
larger
views
ofthings,
see
the
whole
connection
of
general
laws;
and
trace
withadoration,
the
benevolence
and
rectitude
of
the
Deity,
through
all
themazes
and
intricacies
of
his
providence.No!
replied
CLEANTHES,
No!
These
arbitrary
suppositions
can
never
beadmitted,
contrary
to
matter
of
fact,
visible
and
uncontroverted.
Whencecan
any
cause
be
known
but
from
its
known
effects?
Whence
can
anyhypothesis
be
proved
but
from
the
apparent
phenomena?
To
establish
onehypothesis
upon
another,
is
building
entirely
in
the
air;
and
the
utmostwe
ever
attain,
by
these
conjectures
and
fictions,
is
to
ascertain
thebare
possibility
of
our
opinion;
but
never
can
we,
upon
such
terms,establish
its
reality.The
only
method
of
supporting
Divine
benevolence,
and
it
is
what
Iwillingly
embrace,
is
to
deny
absolutely
the
misery
and
wickedness
ofman.
Your
representations
are
exaggerated;
your
melancholy
views
mostlyfictitious;
your
inferences
contrary
to
fact
and
experience.
Health
ismore
common
than
sickness;
pleasure
than
pain;
happiness
than
misery.
Andfor
one
vexation
which
we
meet
with,
we
attain,
upon
computation,
ahundred
enjoyments.Admitting
your
position,
replied
PHILO,
which
yet
is
extremely
doubtful,you
must
at
the
same
time
allow,
that
if
pain
be
less
frequent
thanpleasure,
it
is
infinitely
more
violent
and
durable.
One
hour
of
it
isoften
able
to
outweigh
a
day,
a
week,
a
month
of
our
common
insipidenjoyments;
and
how
many
days,
weeks,
and
months,
are
passed
by
severalin
the
most
acute
torments?
Pleasure,
scarcely
in
one
instance,
is
everable
to
reach
ecstasy
and
rapture;
and
in
no
one
instance
can
it
continuefor
any
time
at
its
highest
pitch
and
altitude.
The
spirits
evaporate,the
nerves
relax,
the
fabric
is
disordered,
and
the
enjoyment
quicklydegenerates
into
fatigue
and
uneasiness.
But
pain
often,
good
God,
howoften!
rises
to
torture
and
agony;
and
the
longer
it
continues,
itbecomes
still
more
genuine
agony
and
torture.
Patience
is
exhausted,courage
languishes,
melancholy
seizes
us,
and
nothing
terminates
ourmisery
but
the
removal
of
its
cause,
or
another
event,
which
is
the
solecure
of
all
evil,
but
which,
from
our
natural
folly,
we
regard
with
stillgreater
horror
and
consternation.But
not
to
insist
upon
these
topics,
continued
PHILO,
though
mostobvious,
certain,
and
important;
I
must
use
the
freedom
to
admonish
you,CLEANTHES,
that
you
have
put
the
controversy
upon
a
most
dangerous
issue,and
are
unawares
introducing
a
total
scepticism
into
the
most
essentialarticles
of
natural
and
revealed
theology.
What!
no
method
of
fixing
ajust
foundation
for
religion,
unless
we
allow
the
happiness
of
humanlife,
and
maintain
a
continued
existence
even
in
this
world,
with
all
ourpresent
pains,
infirmities,
vexations,
and
follies,
to
be
eligible
anddesirable!
But
this
is
contrary
to
every
one's
feeling
and
experience:
Itis
contrary
to
an
authority
so
established
as
nothing
can
subvert.
Nodecisive
proofs
can
ever
be
produced
against
this
authority;
nor
is
itpossible
for
you
to
compute,
estimate,
and
compare,
all
the
pains
and
allthe
pleasures
in
the
lives
of
all
men
and
of
all
animals:
And
thus,
byyour
resting
the
whole
system
of
religion
on
a
point,
which,
from
itsvery
nature,
must
for
ever
be
uncertain,
you
tacitly
confess,
that
thatsystem
is
equally
uncertain.But
allowing
you
what
never
will
be
believed,
at
least
what
you
neverpossibly
can
prove,
that
animal,
or
at
least
human
happiness,
in
thislife,
exceeds
its
misery,
you
have
yet
done
nothing:
For
this
is
not,
byany
means,
what
we
expect
from
infinite
power,
infinite
wisdom,
andinfinite
goodness.
Why
is
there
any
misery
at
all
in
the
world?
Not
bychance
surely.
From
some
cause
then.
Is
it
from
the
intention
of
theDeity?
But
he
is
perfectly
benevolent.
Is
it
contrary
to
his
intention?But
he
is
almighty.
Nothing
can
shake
the
solidity
of
this
reasoning,
soshort,
so
clear,
so
decisive;
except
we
assert,
that
these
subjectsexceed
all
human
capacity,
and
that
our
common
measures
of
truth
andfalsehood
are
not
applicable
to
them;
a
topic
which
I
have
all
alonginsisted
on,
but
which
you
have,
from
the
beginning,
rejected
with
scornand
indignation.But
I
will
be
contented
to
retire
still
from
this
entrenchment,
for
Ideny
that
you
can
ever
force
me
in
it.
I
will
allow,
that
pain
or
miseryin
man
is
compatible
with
infinite
power
and
goodness
in
the
Deity,
evenin
your
sense
of
these
attributes:
What
are
you
advanced
by
all
theseconcessions?
A
mere
possible
compatibility
is
not
sufficient.
You
mustprove
these
pure,
unmixed,
and
uncontrollable
attributes
from
the
presentmixed
and
confused
phenomena,
and
from
these
alone.
A
hopefulundertaking!
Were
the
phenomena
ever
so
pure
and
unmixed,
yet
beingfinite,
they
would
be
insufficient
for
that
purpose.
How
much
more,
wherethey
are
also
so
jarring
and
discordant!Here,
CLEANTHES,
I
find
myself
at
ease
in
my
argument.
Here
I
triumph.Formerly,
when
we
argued
concerning
the
natural
attributes
ofintelligence
and
design,
I
needed
all
my
sceptical
and
metaphysicalsubtlety
to
elude
your
grasp.
In
many
views
of
the
universe,
and
of
itsparts,
particularly
the
latter,
the
beauty
and
fitness
of
final
causesstrike
us
with
such
irresistible
force,
that
all
objections
appear
(whatI
believe
they
really
are)
mere
cavils
and
sophisms;
nor
can
we
thenimagine
how
it
was
ever
possible
for
us
to
repose
any
weight
on
them.
Butthere
is
no
view
of
human
life,
or
of
the
condition
of
mankind,
fromwhich,
without
the
greatest
violence,
we
can
infer
the
moral
attributes,or
learn
that
infinite
benevolence,
conjoined
with
infinite
power
andinfinite
wisdom,
which
we
must
discover
by
the
eyes
of
faith
alone.
It
isyour
turn
now
to
tug
the
labouring
oar,
and
to
support
your
philosophicalsubtleties
against
the
dictates
of
plain
reason
and
experience.PART
11I
scruple
not
to
allow,
said
CLEANTHES,
that
I
have
been
apt
to
suspectthe
frequent
repetition
of
the
word
infinite,
which
we
meet
with
in
alltheological
writers,
to
savour
more
of
panegyric
than
of
philosophy;
andthat
any
purposes
of
reasoning,
and
even
of
religion,
would
be
betterserved,
were
we
to
rest
contented
with
more
accurate
and
more
moderateexpressions.
The
terms,
admirable,
excellent,
superlatively
great,
wise,and
holy;
these
sufficiently
fill
the
imaginations
of
men;
and
any
thingbeyond,
besides
that
it
leads
into
absurdities,
has
no
influence
on
theaffections
or
sentiments.
Thus,
in
the
present
subject,
if
we
abandon
allhuman
analogy,
as
seems
your
intention,
DEMEA,
I
am
afraid
we
abandon
allreligion,
and
retain
no
conception
of
the
great
object
of
our
adoration.If
we
preserve
human
analogy,
we
must
for
ever
find
it
impossible
toreconcile
any
mixture
of
evil
in
the
universe
with
infinite
attributes;much
less
can
we
ever
prove
the
latter
from
the
former.
But
supposing
theAuthor
of
Nature
to
be
finitely
perfect,
though
far
exceeding
mankind,
asatisfactory
account
may
then
be
given
of
natural
and
moral
evil,
andevery
untoward
phenomenon
be
explained
and
adjusted.
A
less
evil
may
thenbe
chosen,
in
order
to
avoid
a
greater;
inconveniences
be
submitted
to,in
order
to
reach
a
desirable
end;
and
in
a
word,
benevolence,
regulatedby
wisdom,
and
limited
by
necessity,
may
produce
just
such
a
world
as
thepresent.
You,
PHILO,
who
are
so
prompt
at
starting
views,
andreflections,
and
analogies,
I
would
gladly
hear,
at
length,
withoutinterruption,
your
opinion
of
this
new
theory;
and
if
it
deserve
ourattention,
we
may
afterwards,
at
more
leisure,
reduce
it
into
form.My
sentiments,
replied
PHILO,
are
not
worth
being
made
a
mystery
of;
andtherefore,
without
any
ceremony,
I
shall
deliver
what
occurs
to
me
withregard
to
the
present
subject.
It
must,
I
think,
be
allowed,
that
if
avery
limited
intelligence,
whom
we
shall
suppose
utterly
unacquaintedwith
the
universe,
were
assured,
that
it
were
the
production
of
a
verygood,
wise,
and
powerful
Being,
however
finite,
he
would,
from
hisconjectures,
form
beforehand
a
different
notion
of
it
from
what
we
findit
to
be
by
experience;
nor
would
he
ever
imagine,
merely
from
theseattributes
of
the
cause,
of
which
he
is
informed,
that
the
effect
couldbe
so
full
of
vice
and
misery
and
disorder,
as
it
appears
in
this
life.Supposing
now,
that
this
person
were
brought
into
the
world,
stillassured
that
it
was
the
workmanship
of
such
a
sublime
and
benevolentBeing;
he
might,
perhaps,
be
surprised
at
the
disappointment;
but
wouldnever
retract
his
former
belief,
if
founded
on
any
very
solid
argument;since
such
a
limited
intelligence
must
be
sensible
of
his
own
blindnessand
ignorance,
and
must
allow,
that
there
may
be
many
solutions
of
thosephenomena,
which
will
for
ever
escape
his
comprehension.
But
supposing,which
is
the
real
case
with
regard
to
man,
that
this
creature
is
notantecedently
convinced
of
a
supreme
intelligence,
benevolent,
andpowerful,
but
is
left
to
gather
such
a
belief
from
the
appearances
ofthings;
this
entirely
alters
the
case,
nor
will
he
ever
find
any
reasonfor
such
a
conclusion.
He
may
be
fully
convinced
of
the
narrow
limits
ofhis
understanding;
but
this
will
not
help
him
in
forming
an
inferenceconcerning
the
goodness
of
superior
powers,
since
he
must
form
thatinference
from
what
he
knows,
not
from
what
he
is
ignorant
of.
The
moreyou
exaggerate
his
weakness
and
ignorance,
the
more
diffident
you
renderhim,
and
give
him
the
greater
suspicion
that
such
subjects
are
beyond
thereach
of
his
faculties.
You
are
obliged,
therefore,
to
reason
with
himmerely
from
the
known
phenomena,
and
to
drop
every
arbitrary
suppositionor
conjecture.Did
I
show
you
a
house
or
palace,
where
there
was
not
one
apartmentconvenient
or
agreeable;
where
the
windows,
doors,
fires,
passages,stairs,
and
the
whole
economy
of
the
building,
were
the
source
of
noise,confusion,
fatigue,
darkness,
and
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold;
youwould
certainly
blame
the
contrivance,
without
any
further
examination.The
architect
would
in
vain
display
his
subtlety,
and
prove
to
you,
thatif
this
door
or
that
window
were
altered,
greater
ills
would
ensue.
Whathe
says
may
be
strictly
true:
The
alteration
of
one
particular,
while
theother
parts
of
the
building
remain,
may
only
augment
the
inconveniences.But
still
you
would
assert
in
general,
that,
if
the
architect
had
hadskill
and
good
intentions,
he
might
have
formed
such
a
plan
of
the
whole,and
might
have
adjusted
the
parts
in
such
a
manner,
as
would
haveremedied
all
or
most
of
these
inconveniences.
His
ignorance,
or
even
yourown
ignorance
of
such
a
plan,
will
never
convince
you
of
theimpossibility
of
it.
If
you
find
any
inconveniences
and
deformities
inthe
building,
you
will
always,
without
entering
into
any
detail,
condemnthe
architect.In
short,
I
repeat
the
question:
Is
the
world,
considered
in
general,
andas
it
appears
to
us
in
this
life,
different
from
what
a
man,
or
such
alimited
being,
would,
beforehand,
expect
from
a
very
powerful,
wise,
andbenevolent
Deity?
It
must
be
strange
prejudice
to
assert
the
contrary.And
from
thence
I
conclude,
that
however
consistent
the
world
may
be,allowing
certain
suppositions
and
conjectures,
with
the
idea
of
such
aDeity,
it
can
never
afford
us
an
inference
concerning
his
existence.
Theconsistence
is
not
absolutely
denied,
only
the
inference.
Conjectures,especially
where
infinity
is
excluded
from
the
Divine
attributes,
mayperhaps
be
sufficient
to
prove
a
consistence,
but
can
never
befoundations
for
any
inference.There
seem
to
be
four
circumstances,
on
which
depend
all,
or
the
greatestpart
of
the
ills,
that
molest
sensible
creatures;
and
it
is
notimpossible
but
all
these
circumstances
may
be
necessary
and
unavoidable.We
know
so
little
beyond
common
life,
or
even
of
common
life,
that,
withregard
to
the
economy
of
a
universe,
there
is
no
conjecture,
howeverwild,
which
may
not
be
just;
nor
any
one,
however
plausible,
which
maynot
be
erroneous.
All
that
belongs
to
human
understanding,
in
this
deepignorance
and
obscurity,
is
to
be
sceptical,
or
at
least
cautious,
andnot
to
admit
of
any
hypothesis
whatever,
much
less
of
any
which
issupported
by
no
appearance
of
probability.
Now,
this
I
assert
to
be
thecase
with
regard
to
all
the
causes
of
evil,
and
the
circumstances
onwhich
it
depends.
None
of
them
appear
to
human
reason
in
the
least
degreenecessary
or
unavoidable;
nor
can
we
suppose
them
such,
without
theutmost
license
of
imagination.The
first
circumstance
which
introduces
evil,
is
that
contrivance
oreconomy
of
the
animal
creation,
by
which
pains,
as
well
as
pleasures,
areemployed
to
excite
all
creatures
to
action,
and
make
them
vigilant
in
thegreat
work
of
self-preservation.
Now
pleasure
alone,
in
its
variousdegrees,
seems
to
human
understanding
sufficient
for
this
purpose.
Allanimals
might
be
constantly
in
a
state
of
enjoyment:
but
when
urged
byany
of
the
necessities
of
nature,
such
as
thirst,
hunger,
weariness;instead
of
pain,
they
might
feel
a
diminution
of
pleasure,
by
which
theymight
be
prompted
to
seek
that
object
which
is
necessary
to
theirsubsistence.
Men
pursue
pleasure
as
eagerly
as
they
avoid
pain;
at
leastthey
might
have
been
so
constituted.
It
seems,
therefore,
plainlypossible
to
carry
on
the
business
of
life
without
any
pain.
Why
then
isany
animal
ever
rendered
susceptible
of
such
a
sensation?
If
animals
canbe
free
from
it
an
hour,
they
might
enjoy
a
perpetual
exemption
from
it;and
it
required
as
particular
a
contrivance
of
their
organs
to
producethat
feeling,
as
to
endow
them
with
sight,
hearing,
or
any
of
the
senses.Shall
we
conjecture,
that
such
a
contrivance
was
necessary,
without
anyappearance
of
reason?
and
shall
we
build
on
that
conjecture
as
on
themost
certain
truth?But
a
capacity
of
pain
would
not
alone
produce
pain,
were
it
not
for
thesecond
circumstance,
viz.
the
conducting
of
the
world
by
general
laws;and
this
seems
nowise
necessary
to
a
very
perfect
Being.
It
is
true,
ifeverything
were
conducted
by
particular
volitions,
the
course
of
naturewould
be
perpetually
broken,
and
no
man
could
employ
his
reason
in
theconduct
of
life.
But
might
not
other
particular
volitions
remedy
thisinconvenience?
In
short,
might
not
the
Deity
exterminate
all
ill,wherever
it
were
to
be
found;
and
produce
all
good,
without
anypreparation,
or
long
progress
of
causes
and
effects?Besides,
we
must
consider,
that,
according
to
the
present
economy
of
theworld,
the
course
of
nature,
though
supposed
exactly
regular,
yet
to
usappears
not
so,
and
many
events
are
uncertain,
and
many
disappoint
ourexpectations.
Health
and
sickness,
calm
and
tempest,
with
an
infinitenumber
of
other
accidents,
whose
causes
are
unknown
and
variable,
have
agreat
influence
both
on
the
fortunes
of
particular
persons
and
on
theprosperity
of
public
societies;
and
indeed
all
human
life,
in
a
manner,depends
on
such
accidents.
A
being,
therefore,
who
knows
the
secretsprings
of
the
universe,
might
easily,
by
particular
volitions,
turn
allthese
accidents
to
the
good
of
mankind,
and
render
the
whole
world
happy,without
discovering
himself
in
any
operation.
A
fleet,
whose
purposeswere
salutary
to
society,
might
always
meet
with
a
fair
wind.
Goodprinces
enjoy
sound
health
and
long
life.
Persons
born
to
power
andauthority,
be
framed
with
good
tempers
and
virtuous
dispositions.
A
fewsuch
events
as
these,
regularly
and
wisely
conducted,
would
change
theface
of
the
world;
and
yet
would
no
more
seem
to
disturb
the
course
ofnature,
or
confound
human
conduct,
than
the
present
economy
of
things,where
the
causes
are
secret,
and
variable,
and
compounded.
Some
smalltouches
given
to
CALIGULA's
brain
in
his
infancy,
might
have
convertedhim
into
a
TRAJAN.
One
wave,
a
little
higher
than
the
rest,
by
buryingCAESAR
and
his
fortune
in
the
bottom
of
the
ocean,
might
have
restoredliberty
to
a
considerable
part
of
mankind.
There
may,
for
aught
we
know,be
good
reasons
why
Providence
interposes
not
in
this
manner;
but
theyare
unknown
to
us;
and
though
the
mere
supposition,
that
such
reasonsexist,
may
be
sufficient
to
save
the
conclusion
concerning
the
Divineattributes,
yet
surely
it
can
never
be
sufficient
to
establish
thatconclusion.If
every
thing
in
the
universe
be
conducted
by
general
laws,
and
ifanimals
be
rendered
susceptible
of
pain,
it
scarcely
seems
possible
butsome
ill
must
arise
in
the
various
shocks
of
matter,
and
the
variousconcurrence
and
opposition
of
general
laws;
but
this
ill
would
be
veryrare,
were
it
not
for
the
third
circumstance,
which
I
proposed
tomention,
viz.
the
great
frugality
with
which
all
powers
and
faculties
aredistributed
to
every
particular
being.
So
well
adjusted
are
the
organsand
capacities
of
all
animals,
and
so
well
fitted
to
their
preservation,that,
as
far
as
history
or
tradition
reaches,
there
appears
not
to
be
anysingle
species
which
has
yet
been
extinguished
in
the
universe.
Everyanimal
has
the
requisite
endowments;
but
these
endowments
are
bestowedwith
so
scrupulous
an
economy,
that
any
considerable
diminution
mustentirely
destroy
the
creature.
Wherever
one
power
is
increased,
there
isa
proportional
abatement
in
the
others.
Animals
which
excel
in
swiftnessare
commonly
defective
in
force.
Those
which
possess
both
are
eitherimperfect
in
some
of
their
senses,
or
are
oppressed
with
the
most
cravingwants.
The
human
species,
whose
chief
excellency
is
reason
and
sagacity,is
of
all
others
the
most
necessitous,
and
the
most
deficient
in
bodilyadvantages;
without
clothes,
without
arms,
without
food,
without
lodging,without
any
convenience
of
life,
except
what
they
owe
to
their
own
skilland
industry.
In
short,
nature
seems
to
have
formed
an
exact
calculationof
the
necessities
of
her
creatures;
and,
like
a
rigid
master,
hasafforded
them
little
more
powers
or
endowments
than
what
are
strictlysufficient
to
supply
those
necessities.
An
indulgent
parent
would
havebestowed
a
large
stock,
in
order
to
guard
against
accidents,
and
securethe
happiness
and
welfare
of
the
creature
in
the
most
unfortunateconcurrence
of
circumstances.
Every
course
of
life
would
not
have
been
sosurrounded
with
precipices,
that
the
least
departure
from
the
true
path,by
mistake
or
necessity,
must
involve
us
in
misery
and
ruin.
Somereserve,
some
fund,
would
have
been
provided
to
ensure
happiness;
norwould
the
powers
and
the
necessities
have
been
adjusted
with
so
rigid
aneconomy.
The
Author
of
Nature
is
inconceivably
powerful:
his
force
issupposed
great,
if
not
altogether
inexhaustible:
nor
is
there
any
reason,as
far
as
we
can
judge,
to
make
him
observe
this
strict
frugality
in
hisdealings
with
his
creatures.
It
would
have
been
better,
were
his
powerextremely
limited,
to
have
created
fewer
animals,
and
to
have
endowedthese
with
more
faculties
for
their
happiness
and
preservation.
A
builderis
never
esteemed
prudent,
who
undertakes
a
plan
beyond
what
his
stockwill
enable
him
to
finish.In
order
to
cure
most
of
the
ills
of
human
life,
I
require
not
that
manshould
have
the
wings
of
the
eagle,
the
swiftness
of
the
stag,
the
forceof
the
ox,
the
arms
of
the
lion,
the
scales
of
the
crocodile
orrhinoceros;
much
less
do
I
demand
the
sagacity
of
an
angel
or
cherubim.
Iam
contented
to
take
an
increase
in
one
single
power
or
faculty
of
hissoul.
Let
him
be
endowed
with
a
greater
propensity
to
industry
andlabour;
a
more
vigorous
spring
and
activity
of
mind;
a
more
constant
bentto
business
and
application.
Let
the
whole
species
possess
naturally
anequal
diligence
with
that
which
many
individuals
are
able
to
attain
byhabit
and
reflection;
and
the
most
beneficial
consequences,
without
anyallay
of
ill,
is
the
immediate
and
necessary
result
of
this
endowment.Almost
all
the
moral,
as
well
as
natural
evils
of
human
life,
arise
fromidleness;
and
were
our
species,
by
the
original
constitution
of
theirframe,
exempt
from
this
vice
or
infirmity,
the
perfect
cultivation
ofland,
the
improvement
of
arts
and
manufactures,
the
exact
execution
ofevery
office
and
duty,
immediately
follow;
and
men
at
once
may
fullyreach
that
state
of
society,
which
is
so
imperfectly
attained
by
the
bestregulated
government.
But
as
industry
is
a
power,
and
the
most
valuableof
any,
Nature
seems
determined,
suitably
to
her
usual
maxims,
to
bestowit
on
men
with
a
very
sparing
hand;
and
rather
to
punish
him
severely
forhis
deficiency
in
it,
than
to
reward
him
for
his
attainments.
She
has
socontrived
his
frame,
that
nothing
but
the
most
violent
necessity
canoblige
him
to
labour;
and
she
employs
all
his
other
wants
to
overcome,
atleast
in
part,
the
want
of
diligence,
and
to
endow
him
with
some
share
ofa
faculty
of
which
she
has
thought
fit
naturally
to
bereave
him.
Here
ourdemands
may
be
allowed
very
humble,
and
therefore
the
more
reasonable.
Ifwe
required
the
endowments
of
superior
penetration
and
judgement,
of
amore
delicate
taste
of
beauty,
of
a
nicer
sensibility
to
benevolence
andfriendship;
we
might
be
told,
that
we
impiously
pretend
to
break
theorder
of
Nature;
that
we
want
to
exalt
ourselves
into
a
higher
rank
ofbeing;
that
the
presents
which
we
require,
not
being
suitable
to
ourstate
and
condition,
would
only
be
pernicious
to
us.
But
it
is
hard;
Idare
to
repeat
it,
it
is
hard,
that
being
placed
in
a
world
so
full
ofwants
and
necessities,
where
almost
every
being
and
element
is
either
ourfoe
or
refuses
its
assistance
...
we
should
also
have
our
own
temper
tostruggle
with,
and
should
be
deprived
of
that
faculty
which
can
alonefence
against
these
multiplied
evils.The
fourth
circumstance,
whence
arises
the
misery
and
ill
of
theuniverse,
is
the
inaccurate
workmanship
of
all
the
springs
and
principlesof
the
great
machine
of
nature.
It
must
be
acknowledged,
that
there
arefew
parts
of
the
universe,
which
seem
not
to
serve
some
purpose,
andwhose
removal
would
not
produce
a
visible
defect
and
disorder
in
thewhole.
The
parts
hang
all
together;
nor
can
one
be
touched
withoutaffecting
the
rest,
in
a
greater
or
less
degree.
But
at
the
same
time,
itmust
be
observed,
that
none
of
these
parts
or
principles,
however
useful,are
so
accurately
adjusted,
as
to
keep
precisely
within
those
bounds
inwhich
their
utility
consists;
but
they
are,
all
of
them,
apt,
on
everyoccasion,
to
run
into
the
one
extreme
or
the
other.
One
would
imagine,that
this
grand
production
had
not
received
the
last
hand
of
the
maker;so
little
finished
is
every
part,
and
so
coarse
are
the
strokes
withwhich
it
is
executed.
Thus,
the
winds
are
requisite
to
convey
the
vapoursalong
the
surface
of
the
globe,
and
to
assist
men
in
navigation:
but
howoft,
rising
up
to
tempests
and
hurricanes,
do
they
become
pernicious?Rains
are
necessary
to
nourish
all
the
plants
and
animals
of
the
earth:but
how
often
are
they
defective?
how
often
excessive?
Heat
is
requisiteto
all
life
and
vegetation;
but
is
not
always
found
in
the
dueproportion.
On
the
mixture
and
secretion
of
the
humours
and
juices
of
thebody
depend
the
health
and
prosperity
of
the
animal:
but
the
partsperform
not
regularly
their
proper
function.
What
more
useful
than
allthe
passions
of
the
mind,
ambition,
vanity,
love,
anger?
But
how
oft
dothey
break
their
bounds,
and
cause
the
greatest
convulsions
in
society?There
is
nothing
so
advantageous
in
the
universe,
but
what
frequentlybecomes
pernicious,
by
its
excess
or
defect;
nor
has
Nature
guarded,
withthe
requisite
accuracy,
against
all
disorder
or
confusion.
Theirregularity
is
never
perhaps
so
great
as
to
destroy
any
species;
but
isoften
sufficient
to
involve
the
individuals
in
ruin
and
misery.On
the
concurrence,
then,
of
these
four
circumstances,
does
all
or
thegreatest
part
of
natural
evil
depend.
Were
all
living
creatures
incapableof
pain,
or
were
the
world
administered
by
particular
volitions,
evilnever
could
have
found
access
into
the
universe:
and
were
animals
endowedwith
a
large
stock
of
powers
and
faculties,
beyond
what
strict
necessityrequires;
or
were
the
several
springs
and
principles
of
the
universe
soaccurately
framed
as
to
preserve
always
the
just
temperament
and
medium;there
must
have
been
very
little
ill
in
comparison
of
what
we
feel
atpresent.
What
then
shall
we
pronounce
on
this
occasion?
Shall
we
say
thatthese
circumstances
are
not
necessary,
and
that
they
might
easily
havebeen
altered
in
the
contrivance
of
the
universe?
This
decision
seems
toopresumptuous
for
creatures
so
blind
and
ignorant.
Let
us
be
more
modestin
our
conclusions.
Let
us
allow,
that,
if
the
goodness
of
the
Deity
(Imean
a
goodness
like
the
human)
could
be
established
on
any
tolerablereasons
a
priori,
these
phenomena,
however
untoward,
would
not
besufficient
to
subvert
that
principle;
but
might
easily,
in
some
unknownmanner,
be
reconcilable
to
it.
But
let
us
still
assert,
that
as
thisgoodness
is
not
antecedently
established,
but
must
be
inferred
from
thephenomena,
there
can
be
no
grounds
for
such
an
inference,
while
there
areso
many
ills
in
the
universe,
and
while
these
ills
might
so
easily
havebeen
remedied,
as
far
as
human
understanding
can
be
allowed
to
judge
onsuch
a
subject.
I
am
Sceptic
enough
to
allow,
that
the
bad
appearances,notwithstanding
all
my
reasonings,
may
be
compatible
with
such
attributesas
you
suppose;
but
surely
they
can
never
prove
these
attributes.
Such
aconclusion
cannot
result
from
Scepticism,
but
must
arise
from
thephenomena,
and
from
our
confidence
in
the
reasonings
which
we
deduce
fromthese
phenomena.Look
round
this
universe.
What
an
immense
profusion
of
beings,
animatedand
organised,
sensible
and
active!
You
admire
this
prodigious
varietyand
fecundity.
But
inspect
a
little
more
narrowly
these
livingexistences,
the
only
beings
worth
regarding.
How
hostile
and
destructiveto
each
other!
How
insufficient
all
of
them
for
their
own
happiness!
Howcontemptible
or
odious
to
the
spectator!
The
whole
presents
nothing
butthe
idea
of
a
blind
Nature,
impregnated
by
a
great
vivifying
principle,and
pouring
forth
from
her
lap,
without
discernment
or
parental
care,
hermaimed
and
abortive
children!Here
the
MANICHAEAN
system
occurs
as
a
proper
hypothesis
to
solve
thedifficulty:
and
no
doubt,
in
some
respects,
it
is
very
specious,
and
hasmore
probability
than
the
common
hypothesis,
by
giving
a
plausibleaccount
of
the
strange
mixture
of
good
and
ill
which
appears
in
life.
Butif
we
consider,
on
the
other
hand,
the
perfect
uniformity
and
agreementof
the
parts
of
the
universe,
we
shall
not
discover
in
it
any
marks
ofthe
combat
of
a
malevolent
with
a
benevolent
being.
There
is
indeed
anopposition
of
pains
and
pleasures
in
the
feelings
of
sensible
creatures:but
are
not
all
the
operations
of
Nature
carried
on
by
an
opposition
ofprinciples,
of
hot
and
cold,
moist
and
dry,
light
and
heavy?
The
trueconclusion
is,
that
the
original
Source
of
all
things
is
entirelyindifferent
to
all
these
principles;
and
has
no
more
regard
to
good
aboveill,
than
to
heat
above
cold,
or
to
drought
above
moisture,
or
to
lightabove
heavy.There
may
four
hypotheses
be
framed
concerning
the
first
causes
of
theuniverse:
that
they
are
endowed
with
perfect
goodness;
that
they
haveperfect
malice;
that
they
are
opposite,
and
have
both
goodness
andmalice;
that
they
have
neither
goodness
nor
malice.
Mixed
phenomena
cannever
prove
the
two
former
unmixed
principles;
and
the
uniformity
andsteadiness
of
general
laws
seem
to
oppose
the
third.
The
fourth,therefore,
seems
by
far
the
most
probable.What
I
have
said
concerning
natural
evil
will
apply
to
moral,
with
littleor
no
variation;
and
we
have
no
more
reason
to
infer,
that
the
rectitudeof
the
Supreme
Being
resembles
human
rectitude,
than
that
his
benevolenceresembles
the
human.
Nay,
it
will
be
thought,
that
we
have
still
greatercause
to
exclude
from
him
moral
sentiments,
such
as
we
feel
them;
sincemoral
evil,
in
the
opinion
of
many,
is
much
more
predominant
above
moralgood
than
natural
evil
above
natural
good.But
even
though
this
should
not
be
allowed,
and
though
the
virtue
whichis
in
mankind
should
be
acknowledged
much
superior
to
the
vice,
yet
solong
as
there
is
any
vice
at
all
in
the
universe,
it
will
very
muchpuzzle
you
Anthropomorphites,
how
to
account
for
it.
You
must
assign
acause
for
it,
without
having
recourse
to
the
first
cause.
But
as
everyeffect
must
have
a
cause,
and
that
cause
another,
you
must
either
carryon
the
progression
in
infinitum,
or
rest
on
that
original
principle,
whois
the
ultimate
cause
of
all
things...Hold!
hold!
cried
DEMEA:
Whither
does
your
imagination
hurry
you?
Ijoined
in
alliance
with
you,
in
order
to
prove
the
incomprehensiblenature
of
the
Divine
Being,
and
refute
the
principles
of
CLEANTHES,
whowould
measure
every
thing
by
human
rule
and
standard.
But
I
now
find
yourunning
into
all
the
topics
of
the
greatest
libertines
and
infidels,
andbetraying
that
holy
cause
which
you
seemingly
espoused.
Are
you
secretly,then,
a
more
dangerous
enemy
than
CLEANTHES
himself?And
are
you
so
late
in
perceiving
it?
replied
CLEANTHES.
Believe
me,DEMEA,
your
friend
PHILO,
from
the
beginning,
has
been
amusing
himself
atboth
our
expense;
and
it
must
be
confessed,
that
the
injudiciousreasoning
of
our
vulgar
theology
has
given
him
but
too
just
a
handle
ofridicule.
The
total
infirmity
of
human
reason,
the
absoluteincomprehensibility
of
the
Divine
Nature,
the
great
and
universal
misery,and
still
greater
wickedness
of
men;
these
are
strange
topics,
surely,
tobe
so
fondly
cherished
by
orthodox
divines
and
doctors.
In
ages
ofstupidity
and
ignorance,
indeed,
these
principles
may
safely
be
espoused;and
perhaps
no
views
of
things
are
more
proper
to
promote
superstition,than
such
as
encourage
the
blind
amazement,
the
diffidence,
andmelancholy
of
mankind.
But
at
present...Blame
not
so
much,
interposed
PHILO,
the
ignorance
of
these
reverendgentlemen.
They
know
how
to
change
their
style
with
the
times.
Formerlyit
was
a
most
popular
theological
topic
to
maintain,
that
human
life
wasvanity
and
misery,
and
to
exaggerate
all
the
ills
and
pains
which
areincident
to
men.
But
of
late
years,
divines,
we
find,
begin
to
retractthis
position;
and
maintain,
though
still
with
some
hesitation,
thatthere
are
more
goods
than
evils,
more
pleasures
than
pains,
even
in
thislife.
When
religion
stood
entirely
upon
temper
and
education,
it
wasthought
proper
to
encourage
melancholy;
as
indeed
mankind
never
haverecourse
to
superior
powers
so
readily
as
in
that
disposition.
But
as
menhave
now
learned
to
form
principles,
and
to
draw
consequences,
it
isnecessary
to
change
the
batteries,
and
to
make
use
of
such
arguments
aswill
endure
at
least
some
scrutiny
and
examination.
This
variation
is
thesame
(and
from
the
same
causes)
with
that
which
I
formerly
remarked
withregard
to
Scepticism.Thus
PHILO
continued
to
the
last
his
spirit
of
opposition,
and
his
censureof
established
opinions.
But
I
could
observe
that
DEMEA
did
not
at
allrelish
the
latter
part
of
the
discourse;
and
he
took
occasion
soon
after,on
some
pretence
or
other,
to
leave
the
company.PART
12After
DEMEA's
departure,
CLEANTHES
and
PHILO
continued
the
conversationin
the
following
manner.
Our
friend,
I
am
afraid,
said
CLEANTHES,
willhave
little
inclination
to
revive
this
topic
of
discourse,
while
you
arein
company;
and
to
tell
truth,
PHILO,
I
should
rather
wish
to
reason
witheither
of
you
apart
on
a
subject
so
sublime
and
interesting.
Your
spiritof
controversy,
joined
to
your
abhorrence
of
vulgar
superstition,
carriesyou
strange
lengths,
when
engaged
in
an
argument;
and
there
is
nothing
sosacred
and
venerable,
even
in
your
own
eyes,
which
you
spare
on
thatoccasion.I
must
confess,
replied
PHILO,
that
I
am
less
cautious
on
the
subject
ofNatural
Religion
than
on
any
other;
both
because
I
know
that
I
can
never,on
that
head,
corrupt
the
principles
of
any
man
of
common
sense;
andbecause
no
one,
I
am
confident,
in
whose
eyes
I
appear
a
man
of
commonsense,
will
ever
mistake
my
intentions.
You,
in
particular,
CLEANTHES,with
whom
I
live
in
unreserved
intimacy;
you
are
sensible,
thatnotwithstanding
the
freedom
of
my
conversation,
and
my
love
of
singulararguments,
no
one
has
a
deeper
sense
of
religion
impressed
on
his
mind,or
pays
more
profound
adoration
to
the
Divine
Being,
as
he
discovershimself
to
reason,
in
the
inexplicable
contrivance
and
artifice
ofnature.
A
purpose,
an
intention,
a
design,
strikes
every
where
the
mostcareless,
the
most
stupid
thinker;
and
no
man
can
be
so
hardened
inabsurd
systems,
as
at
all
times
to
reject
it.
That
Nature
does
nothing
invain,
is
a
maxim
established
in
all
the
schools,
merely
from
thecontemplation
of
the
works
of
Nature,
without
any
religious
purpose;
and,from
a
firm
conviction
of
its
truth,
an
anatomist,
who
had
observed
a
neworgan
or
canal,
would
never
be
satisfied
till
he
had
also
discovered
itsuse
and
intention.
One
great
foundation
of
the
Copernican
system
is
themaxim,
That
Nature
acts
by
the
simplest
methods,
and
chooses
the
mostproper
means
to
any
end;
and
astronomers
often,
without
thinking
of
it,lay
this
strong
foundation
of
piety
and
religion.
The
same
thing
isobservable
in
other
parts
of
philosophy:
And
thus
all
the
sciences
almostlead
us
insensibly
to
acknowledge
a
first
intelligent
Author;
and
theirauthority
is
often
so
much
the
greater,
as
they
do
not
directly
professthat
intention.It
is
with
pleasure
I
hear
GALEN
reason
concerning
the
structure
of
thehuman
body.
The
anatomy
of
a
man,
says
he
[De
formatione
foetus],
discoversabove
600
different
muscles;
and
whoever
duly
considers
these,
will
find,that,
in
each
of
them,
Nature
must
have
adjusted
at
least
ten
differentcircumstances,
in
order
to
attain
the
end
which
she
proposed;
properfigure,
just
magnitude,
right
disposition
of
the
several
ends,
upper
andlower
position
of
the
whole,
the
due
insertion
of
the
several
nerves,veins,
and
arteries:
So
that,
in
the
muscles
alone,
above
6000
severalviews
and
intentions
must
have
been
formed
and
executed.
The
bones
hecalculates
to
be
284:
The
distinct
purposes
aimed
at
in
the
structure
ofeach,
above
forty.
What
a
prodigious
display
of
artifice,
even
in
thesesimple
and
homogeneous
parts!
But
if
we
consider
the
skin,
ligaments,vessels,
glandules,
humours,
the
several
limbs
and
members
of
the
body;how
must
our
astonishment
rise
upon
us,
in
proportion
to
the
number
andintricacy
of
the
parts
so
artificially
adjusted!
The
further
we
advancein
these
researches,
we
discover
new
scenes
of
art
and
wisdom:
But
descrystill,
at
a
distance,
further
scenes
beyond
our
reach;
in
the
fineinternal
structure
of
the
parts,
in
the
economy
of
the
brain,
in
thefabric
of
the
seminal
vessels.
All
these
artifices
are
repeated
in
everydifferent
species
of
animal,
with
wonderful
variety,
and
with
exactpropriety,
suited
to
the
different
intentions
of
Nature
in
framing
eachspecies.
And
if
the
infidelity
of
GALEN,
even
when
these
natural
scienceswere
still
imperfect,
could
not
withstand
such
striking
appearances,
towhat
pitch
of
pertinacious
obstinacy
must
a
philosopher
in
this
age
haveattained,
who
can
now
doubt
of
a
Supreme
Intelligence!Could
I
meet
with
one
of
this
species
(who,
I
thank
God,
are
very
rare),I
would
ask
him:
Supposing
there
were
a
God,
who
did
not
discover
himselfimmediately
to
our
senses,
were
it
possible
for
him
to
give
strongerproofs
of
his
existence,
than
what
appear
on
the
whole
face
of
Nature?What
indeed
could
such
a
Divine
Being
do,
but
copy
the
present
economy
ofthings;
render
many
of
his
artifices
so
plain,
that
no
stupidity
couldmistake
them;
afford
glimpses
of
still
greater
artifices,
whichdemonstrate
his
prodigious
superiority
above
our
narrow
apprehensions;and
conceal
altogether
a
great
many
from
such
imperfect
creatures?
Now,according
to
all
rules
of
just
reasoning,
every
fact
must
pass
forundisputed,
when
it
is
supported
by
all
the
arguments
which
its
natureadmits
of;
even
though
these
arguments
be
not,
in
themselves,
verynumerous
or
forcible:
How
much
more,
in
the
present
case,
where
no
humanimagination
can
compute
their
number,
and
no
understanding
estimate
theircogency!I
shall
further
add,
said
CLEANTHES,
to
what
you
have
so
well
urged,
thatone
great
advantage
of
the
principle
of
Theism,
is,
that
it
is
the
onlysystem
of
cosmogony
which
can
be
rendered
intelligible
and
complete,
andyet
can
throughout
preserve
a
strong
analogy
to
what
we
every
day
see
andexperience
in
the
world.
The
comparison
of
the
universe
to
a
machine
ofhuman
contrivance,
is
so
obvious
and
natural,
and
is
justified
by
so
manyinstances
of
order
and
design
in
Nature,
that
it
must
immediately
strikeall
unprejudiced
apprehensions,
and
procure
universal
approbation.Whoever
attempts
to
weaken
this
theory,
cannot
pretend
to
succeed
byestablishing
in
its
place
any
other
that
is
precise
and
determinate:
Itis
sufficient
for
him
if
he
start
doubts
and
difficulties;
and
by
remoteand
abstract
views
of
things,
reach
that
suspense
of
judgement,
which
ishere
the
utmost
boundary
of
his
wishes.
But,
besides
that
this
state
ofmind
is
in
itself
unsatisfactory,
it
can
never
be
steadily
maintainedagainst
such
striking
appearances
as
continually
engage
us
into
thereligious
hypothesis.
A
false,
absurd
system,
human
nature,
from
theforce
of
prejudice,
is
capable
of
adhering
to
with
obstinacy
andperseverance:
But
no
system
at
all,
in
opposition
to
a
theory
supportedby
strong
and
obvious
reason,
by
natural
propensity,
and
by
earlyeducation,
I
think
it
absolutely
impossible
to
maintain
or
defend.So
little,
replied
PHILO,
do
I
esteem
this
suspense
of
judgement
in
thepresent
case
to
be
possible,
that
I
am
apt
to
suspect
there
enterssomewhat
of
a
dispute
of
words
into
this
controversy,
more
than
isusually
imagined.
That
the
works
of
Nature
bear
a
great
analogy
to
theproductions
of
art,
is
evident;
and
according
to
all
the
rules
of
goodreasoning,
we
ought
to
infer,
if
we
argue
at
all
concerning
them,
thattheir
causes
have
a
proportional
analogy.
But
as
there
are
alsoconsiderable
differences,
we
have
reason
to
suppose
a
proportionaldifference
in
the
causes;
and
in
particular,
ought
to
attribute
a
muchhigher
degree
of
power
and
energy
to
the
supreme
cause,
than
any
we
haveever
observed
in
mankind.
Here
then
the
existence
of
a
DEITY
is
plainlyascertained
by
reason:
and
if
we
make
it
a
question,
whether,
on
accountof
these
analogies,
we
can
properly
call
him
a
mind
or
intelligence,notwithstanding
the
vast
difference
which
may
reasonably
be
supposedbetween
him
and
human
minds;
what
is
this
but
a
mere
verbal
controversy?No
man
can
deny
the
analogies
between
the
effects:
To
restrain
ourselvesfrom
inquiring
concerning
the
causes
is
scarcely
possible.
From
thisinquiry,
the
legitimate
conclusion
is,
that
the
causes
have
also
ananalogy:
And
if
we
are
not
contented
with
calling
the
first
and
supremecause
a
GOD
or
DEITY,
but
desire
to
vary
the
expression;
what
can
we
callhim
but
MIND
or
THOUGHT,
to
which
he
is
justly
supposed
to
bear
aconsiderable
resemblance?All
men
of
sound
reason
are
disgusted
with
verbal
disputes,
which
aboundso
much
in
philosophical
and
theological
inquiries;
and
it
is
found,
thatthe
only
remedy
for
this
abuse
must
arise
from
clear
definitions,
fromthe
precision
of
those
ideas
which
enter
into
any
argument,
and
from
thestrict
and
uniform
use
of
those
terms
which
are
employed.
But
there
is
aspecies
of
controversy,
which,
from
the
very
nature
of
language
and
ofhuman
ideas,
is
involved
in
perpetual
ambiguity,
and
can
never,
by
anyprecaution
or
any
definitions,
be
able
to
reach
a
reasonable
certainty
orprecision.
These
are
the
controversies
concerning
the
degrees
of
anyquality
or
circumstance.
Men
may
argue
to
all
eternity,
whether
HANNIBALbe
a
great,
or
a
very
great,
or
a
superlatively
great
man,
what
degree
ofbeauty
CLEOPATRA
possessed,
what
epithet
of
praise
LIVY
or
THUCYDIDES
isentitled
to,
without
bringing
the
controversy
to
any
determination.
Thedisputants
may
here
agree
in
their
sense,
and
differ
in
the
terms,
orvice
versa;
yet
never
be
able
to
define
their
terms,
so
as
to
enter
intoeach
other's
meaning:
Because
the
degrees
of
these
qualities
are
not,like
quantity
or
number,
susceptible
of
any
exact
mensuration,
whichmay
be
the
standard
in
the
controversy.
That
the
dispute
concerningTheism
is
of
this
nature,
and
consequently
is
merely
verbal,
or
perhaps,if
possible,
still
more
incurably
ambiguous,
will
appear
upon
theslightest
inquiry.
I
ask
the
Theist,
if
he
does
not
allow,
that
there
isa
great
and
immeasurable,
because
incomprehensible
difference
between
thehuman
and
the
divine
mind:
The
more
pious
he
is,
the
more
readily
will
heassent
to
the
affirmative,
and
the
more
will
he
be
disposed
to
magnifythe
difference:
He
will
even
assert,
that
the
difference
is
of
a
naturewhich
cannot
be
too
much
magnified.
I
next
turn
to
the
Atheist,
who,
Iassert,
is
only
nominally
so,
and
can
never
possibly
be
in
earnest;
and
Iask
him,
whether,
from
the
coherence
and
apparent
sympathy
in
all
theparts
of
this
world,
there
be
not
a
certain
degree
of
analogy
among
allthe
operations
of
Nature,
in
every
situation
and
in
every
age;
whetherthe
rotting
of
a
turnip,
the
generation
of
an
animal,
and
the
structureof
human
thought,
be
not
energies
that
probably
bear
some
remote
analogyto
each
other:
It
is
impossible
he
can
deny
it:
He
will
readilyacknowledge
it.
Having
obtained
this
concession,
I
push
him
still
furtherin
his
retreat;
and
I
ask
him,
if
it
be
not
probable,
that
the
principlewhich
first
arranged,
and
still
maintains
order
in
this
universe,
bearsnot
also
some
remote
inconceivable
analogy
to
the
other
operations
ofnature,
and,
among
the
rest,
to
the
economy
of
human
mind
and
thought.However
reluctant,
he
must
give
his
assent.
Where
then,
cry
I
to
boththese
antagonists,
is
the
subject
of
your
dispute?
The
Theist
allows,that
the
original
intelligence
is
very
different
from
human
reason:
TheAtheist
allows,
that
the
original
principle
of
order
bears
some
remoteanalogy
to
it.
Will
you
quarrel,
Gentlemen,
about
the
degrees,
and
enterinto
a
controversy,
which
admits
not
of
any
precise
meaning,
norconsequently
of
any
determination?
If
you
should
be
so
obstinate,
Ishould
not
be
surprised
to
find
you
insensibly
change
sides;
while
theTheist,
on
the
one
hand,
exaggerates
the
dissimilarity
between
theSupreme
Being,
and
frail,
imperfect,
variable,
fleeting,
and
mortalcreatures;
and
the
Atheist,
on
the
other,
magnifies
the
analogy
among
allthe
operations
of
Nature,
in
every
period,
every
situation,
and
everyposition.
Consider
then,
where
the
real
point
of
controversy
lies;
and
ifyou
cannot
lay
aside
your
disputes,
endeavour,
at
least,
to
cureyourselves
of
your
animosity.And
here
I
must
also
acknowledge,
CLEANTHES,
that
as
the
works
of
Naturehave
a
much
greater
analogy
to
the
effects
of
our
art
and
contrivance,than
to
those
of
our
benevolence
and
justice,
we
have
reason
to
infer,that
the
natural
attributes
of
the
Deity
have
a
greater
resemblance
tothose
of
men,
than
his
moral
have
to
human
virtues.
But
what
is
theconsequence?
Nothing
but
this,
that
the
moral
qualities
of
man
are
moredefective
in
their
kind
than
his
natural
abilities.
For,
as
the
SupremeBeing
is
allowed
to
be
absolutely
and
entirely
perfect,
whatever
differsmost
from
him,
departs
the
furthest
from
the
supreme
standard
ofrectitude
and
perfection.It
seems
evident
that
the
dispute
between
the
Skeptics
and
Dogmatistsis
entirely
verbal,
or
at
least
regards
only
the
degrees
of
doubt
andassurance
which
we
ought
to
indulge
with
regard
to
all
reasoning;
and
suchdisputes
are
commonly,
at
the
bottom,
verbal,
and
admit
not
of
any
precisedetermination.
No
philosophical
Dogmatist
denies
that
there
aredifficulties
both
with
regard
to
the
senses
and
to
all
science,
and
thatthese
difficulties
are
in
a
regular,
logical
method,
absolutelyinsolvable.
No
Skeptic
denies
that
we
lie
under
an
absolute
necessity,notwithstanding
these
difficulties,
of
thinking,
and
believing,
andreasoning,
with
regard
to
all
kinds
of
subjects,
and
even
of
frequentlyassenting
with
confidence
and
security.
The
only
difference,
then,
betweenthese
sects,
if
they
merit
that
name,
is,
that
the
Sceptic,
from
habit,caprice,
or
inclination,
insists
most
on
the
difficulties;
the
Dogmatist,for
like
reasons,
on
the
necessity.These,
CLEANTHES,
are
my
unfeigned
sentiments
on
this
subject;
and
thesesentiments,
you
know,
I
have
ever
cherished
and
maintained.
But
inproportion
to
my
veneration
for
true
religion,
is
my
abhorrence
of
vulgarsuperstitions;
and
I
indulge
a
peculiar
pleasure,
I
confess,
in
pushingsuch
principles,
sometimes
into
absurdity,
sometimes
into
impiety.
Andyou
are
sensible,
that
all
bigots,
notwithstanding
their
great
aversionto
the
latter
above
the
former,
are
commonly
equally
guilty
of
both.My
inclination,
replied
CLEANTHES,
lies,
I
own,
a
contrary
way.
Religion,however
corrupted,
is
still
better
than
no
religion
at
all.
The
doctrineof
a
future
state
is
so
strong
and
necessary
a
security
to
morals,
thatwe
never
ought
to
abandon
or
neglect
it.
For
if
finite
and
temporaryrewards
and
punishments
have
so
great
an
effect,
as
we
daily
find;
howmuch
greater
must
be
expected
from
such
as
are
infinite
and
eternal?How
happens
it
then,
said
PHILO,
if
vulgar
superstition
be
so
salutary
tosociety,
that
all
history
abounds
so
much
with
accounts
of
its
perniciousconsequences
on
public
affairs?
Factions,
civil
wars,
persecutions,subversions
of
government,
oppression,
slavery;
these
are
the
dismalconsequences
which
always
attend
its
prevalency
over
the
minds
of
men.
Ifthe
religious
spirit
be
ever
mentioned
in
any
historical
narration,
weare
sure
to
meet
afterwards
with
a
detail
of
the
miseries
which
attendit.
And
no
period
of
time
can
be
happier
or
more
prosperous,
than
thosein
which
it
is
never
regarded
or
heard
of.The
reason
of
this
observation,
replied
CLEANTHES,
is
obvious.
The
properoffice
of
religion
is
to
regulate
the
heart
of
men,
humanise
theirconduct,
infuse
the
spirit
of
temperance,
order,
and
obedience;
and
asits
operation
is
silent,
and
only
enforces
the
motives
of
morality
andjustice,
it
is
in
danger
of
being
overlooked,
and
confounded
with
theseother
motives.
When
it
distinguishes
itself,
and
acts
as
a
separateprinciple
over
men,
it
has
departed
from
its
proper
sphere,
and
hasbecome
only
a
cover
to
faction
and
ambition.And
so
will
all
religion,
said
PHILO,
except
the
philosophical
andrational
kind.
Your
reasonings
are
more
easily
eluded
than
my
facts.
Theinference
is
not
just,
because
finite
and
temporary
rewards
andpunishments
have
so
great
influence,
that
therefore
such
as
are
infiniteand
eternal
must
have
so
much
greater.
Consider,
I
beseech
you,
theattachment
which
we
have
to
present
things,
and
the
little
concern
whichwe
discover
for
objects
so
remote
and
uncertain.
When
divines
aredeclaiming
against
the
common
behaviour
and
conduct
of
the
world,
theyalways
represent
this
principle
as
the
strongest
imaginable
(which
indeedit
is);
and
describe
almost
all
human
kind
as
lying
under
the
influenceof
it,
and
sunk
into
the
deepest
lethargy
and
unconcern
about
theirreligious
interests.
Yet
these
same
divines,
when
they
refute
theirspeculative
antagonists,
suppose
the
motives
of
religion
to
be
sopowerful,
that,
without
them,
it
were
impossible
for
civil
society
tosubsist;
nor
are
they
ashamed
of
so
palpable
a
contradiction.
It
iscertain,
from
experience,
that
the
smallest
grain
of
natural
honesty
andbenevolence
has
more
effect
on
men's
conduct,
than
the
most
pompous
viewssuggested
by
theological
theories
and
systems.
A
man's
naturalinclination
works
incessantly
upon
him;
it
is
for
ever
present
to
themind,
and
mingles
itself
with
every
view
and
consideration:
whereasreligious
motives,
where
they
act
at
all,
operate
only
by
starts
andbounds;
and
it
is
scarcely
possible
for
them
to
become
altogetherhabitual
to
the
mind.
The
force
of
the
greatest
gravity,
say
thephilosophers,
is
infinitely
small,
in
comparison
of
that
of
the
leastimpulse:
yet
it
is
certain,
that
the
smallest
gravity
will,
in
the
end,prevail
above
a
great
impulse;
because
no
strokes
or
blows
can
berepeated
with
such
constancy
as
attraction
and
gravitation.Another
advantage
of
inclination:
It
engages
on
its
side
all
the
wit
andingenuity
of
the
mind;
and
when
set
in
opposition
to
religiousprinciples,
seeks
every
method
and
art
of
eluding
them:
In
which
it
isalmost
always
successful.
Who
can
explain
the
heart
of
man,
or
accountfor
those
strange
salvos
and
excuses,
with
which
people
satisfythemselves,
when
they
follow
their
inclinations
in
opposition
to
theirreligious
duty?
This
is
well
understood
in
the
world;
and
none
but
foolsever
repose
less
trust
in
a
man,
because
they
hear,
that
from
study
andphilosophy,
he
has
entertained
some
speculative
doubts
with
regard
totheological
subjects.
And
when
we
have
to
do
with
a
man,
who
makes
agreat
profession
of
religion
and
devotion,
has
this
any
other
effect
uponseveral,
who
pass
for
prudent,
than
to
put
them
on
their
guard,
lest
theybe
cheated
and
deceived
by
him?We
must
further
consider,
that
philosophers,
who
cultivate
reason
andreflection,
stand
less
in
need
of
such
motives
to
keep
them
under
therestraint
of
morals;
and
that
the
vulgar,
who
alone
may
need
them,
areutterly
incapable
of
so
pure
a
religion
as
represents
the
Deity
to
bepleased
with
nothing
but
virtue
in
human
behaviour.
The
recommendationsto
the
Divinity
are
generally
supposed
to
be
either
frivolousobservances,
or
rapturous
ecstasies,
or
a
bigoted
credulity.
We
need
notrun
back
into
antiquity,
or
wander
into
remote
regions,
to
find
instancesof
this
degeneracy.
Amongst
ourselves,
some
have
been
guilty
of
thatatrociousness,
unknown
to
the
Egyptian
and
Grecian
superstitions,
ofdeclaiming
in
express
terms,
against
morality;
and
representing
it
as
asure
forfeiture
of
the
Divine
favour,
if
the
least
trust
or
reliance
belaid
upon
it.But
even
though
superstition
or
enthusiasm
should
not
put
itself
indirect
opposition
to
morality;
the
very
diverting
of
the
attention,
theraising
up
a
new
and
frivolous
species
of
merit,
the
preposterousdistribution
which
it
makes
of
praise
and
blame,
must
have
the
mostpernicious
consequences,
and
weaken
extremely
men's
attachment
to
thenatural
motives
of
justice
and
humanity.Such
a
principle
of
action
likewise,
not
being
any
of
the
familiarmotives
of
human
conduct,
acts
only
by
intervals
on
the
temper;
and
mustbe
roused
by
continual
efforts,
in
order
to
render
the
pious
zealotsatisfied
with
his
own
conduct,
and
make
him
fulfil
his
devotional
task.Many
religious
exercises
are
entered
into
with
seeming
fervour,
where
theheart,
at
the
time,
feels
cold
and
languid:
A
habit
of
dissimulation
isby
degrees
contracted;
and
fraud
and
falsehood
become
the
predominantprinciple.
Hence
the
reason
of
that
vulgar
observation,
that
the
highestzeal
in
religion
and
the
deepest
hypocrisy,
so
far
from
beinginconsistent,
are
often
or
commonly
united
in
the
same
individualcharacter.The
bad
effects
of
such
habits,
even
in
common
life,
are
easily
imagined;but
where
the
interests
of
religion
are
concerned,
no
morality
can
beforcible
enough
to
bind
the
enthusiastic
zealot.
The
sacredness
of
thecause
sanctifies
every
measure
which
can
be
made
use
of
to
promote
it.The
steady
attention
alone
to
so
important
an
interest
as
that
of
eternalsalvation,
is
apt
to
extinguish
the
benevolent
affections,
and
beget
anarrow,
contracted
selfishness.
And
when
such
a
temper
is
encouraged,
iteasily
eludes
all
the
general
precepts
of
charity
and
benevolence.Thus,
the
motives
of
vulgar
superstition
have
no
great
influence
ongeneral
conduct;
nor
is
their
operation
favourable
to
morality,
in
theinstances
where
they
predominate.Is
there
any
maxim
in
politics
more
certain
and
infallible,
than
thatboth
the
number
and
authority
of
priests
should
be
confined
within
verynarrow
limits;
and
that
the
civil
magistrate
ought,
for
ever,
to
keep
hisfasces
and
axes
from
such
dangerous
hands?
But
if
the
spirit
of
popularreligion
were
so
salutary
to
society,
a
contrary
maxim
ought
to
prevail.The
greater
number
of
priests,
and
their
greater
authority
and
riches,will
always
augment
the
religious
spirit.
And
though
the
priests
have
theguidance
of
this
spirit,
why
may
we
not
expect
a
superior
sanctity
oflife,
and
greater
benevolence
and
moderation,
from
persons
who
are
setapart
for
religion,
who
are
continually
inculcating
it
upon
others,
andwho
must
themselves
imbibe
a
greater
share
of
it?
Whence
comes
it
then,that,
in
fact,
the
utmost
a
wise
magistrate
can
propose
with
regard
topopular
religions,
is,
as
far
as
possible,
to
make
a
saving
game
of
it,and
to
prevent
their
pernicious
consequences
with
regard
to
society?Every
expedient
which
he
tries
for
so
humble
a
purpose
is
surrounded
withinconveniences.
If
he
admits
only
one
religion
among
his
subjects,
hemust
sacrifice,
to
an
uncertain
prospect
of
tranquillity,
everyconsideration
of
public
liberty,
science,
reason,
industry,
and
even
hisown
independency.
If
he
gives
indulgence
to
several
sects,
which
is
thewiser
maxim,
he
must
preserve
a
very
philosophical
indifference
to
all
ofthem,
and
carefully
restrain
the
pretensions
of
the
prevailing
sect;otherwise
he
can
expect
nothing
but
endless
disputes,
quarrels,
factions,persecutions,
and
civil
commotions.True
religion,
I
allow,
has
no
such
pernicious
consequences:
but
we
musttreat
of
religion,
as
it
has
commonly
been
found
in
the
world;
nor
have
Iany
thing
to
do
with
that
speculative
tenet
of
Theism,
which,
as
it
is
aspecies
of
philosophy,
must
partake
of
the
beneficial
influence
of
thatprinciple,
and
at
the
same
time
must
lie
under
a
like
inconvenience,
ofbeing
always
confined
to
very
few
persons.Oaths
are
requisite
in
all
courts
of
judicature;
but
it
is
a
questionwhether
their
authority
arises
from
any
popular
religion.
It
is
thesolemnity
and
importance
of
the
occasion,
the
regard
to
reputation,
andthe
reflecting
on
the
general
interests
of
society,
which
are
the
chiefrestraints
upon
mankind.
Custom-house
oaths
and
political
oaths
are
butlittle
regarded
even
by
some
who
pretend
to
principles
of
honesty
andreligion;
and
a
Quaker's
asseveration
is
with
us
justly
put
upon
the
samefooting
with
the
oath
of
any
other
person.
I
know,
that
POLYBIUS[Lib.
vi.
cap.
54.]
ascribes
the
infamy
of
GREEK
faith
to
the
prevalency
ofthe
EPICUREAN
philosophy:
but
I
know
also,
that
Punic
faith
had
as
bad
areputation
in
ancient
times
as
Irish
evidence
has
in
modern;
though
wecannot
account
for
these
vulgar
observations
by
the
same
reason.
Not
tomention
that
Greek
faith
was
infamous
before
the
rise
of
the
Epicureanphilosophy;
and
EURIPIDES
[Iphigenia
in
Tauride],
in
a
passage
which
Ishall
point
out
to
you,
has
glanced
a
remarkable
stroke
of
satire
againsthis
nation,
with
regard
to
this
circumstance.Take
care,
PHILO,
replied
CLEANTHES,
take
care:
push
not
matters
too
far:allow
not
your
zeal
against
false
religion
to
undermine
your
venerationfor
the
true.
Forfeit
not
this
principle,
the
chief,
the
only
greatcomfort
in
life;
and
our
principal
support
amidst
all
the
attacks
ofadverse
fortune.
The
most
agreeable
reflection,
which
it
is
possible
forhuman
imagination
to
suggest,
is
that
of
genuine
Theism,
which
representsus
as
the
workmanship
of
a
Being
perfectly
good,
wise,
and
powerful;
whocreated
us
for
happiness;
and
who,
having
implanted
in
us
immeasurabledesires
of
good,
will
prolong
our
existence
to
all
eternity,
and
willtransfer
us
into
an
infinite
variety
of
scenes,
in
order
to
satisfy
thosedesires,
and
render
our
felicity
complete
and
durable.
Next
to
such
aBeing
himself
(if
the
comparison
be
allowed),
the
happiest
lot
which
wecan
imagine,
is
that
of
being
under
his
guardianship
and
protection.These
appearances,
said
PHILO,
are
most
engaging
and
alluring;
and
withregard
to
the
true
philosopher,
they
are
more
than
appearances.
But
ithappens
here,
as
in
the
former
case,
that,
with
regard
to
the
greaterpart
of
mankind,
the
appearances
are
deceitful,
and
that
the
terrors
ofreligion
commonly
prevail
above
its
comforts.It
is
allowed,
that
men
never
have
recourse
to
devotion
so
readily
aswhen
dejected
with
grief
or
depressed
with
sickness.
Is
not
this
a
proof,that
the
religious
spirit
is
not
so
nearly
allied
to
joy
as
to
sorrow?But
men,
when
afflicted,
find
consolation
in
religion,
replied
CLEANTHES.Sometimes,
said
PHILO:
but
it
is
natural
to
imagine,
that
they
will
forma
notion
of
those
unknown
beings,
suitably
to
the
present
gloom
andmelancholy
of
their
temper,
when
they
betake
themselves
to
thecontemplation
of
them.
Accordingly,
we
find
the
tremendous
images
topredominate
in
all
religions;
and
we
ourselves,
after
having
employed
themost
exalted
expression
in
our
descriptions
of
the
Deity,
fall
into
theflattest
contradiction
in
affirming
that
the
damned
are
infinitelysuperior
in
number
to
the
elect.I
shall
venture
to
affirm,
that
there
never
was
a
popular
religion,
whichrepresented
the
state
of
departed
souls
in
such
a
light,
as
would
renderit
eligible
for
human
kind
that
there
should
be
such
a
state.
These
finemodels
of
religion
are
the
mere
product
of
philosophy.
For
as
death
liesbetween
the
eye
and
the
prospect
of
futurity,
that
event
is
so
shockingto
Nature,
that
it
must
throw
a
gloom
on
all
the
regions
which
lie
beyondit;
and
suggest
to
the
generality
of
mankind
the
idea
of
CERBERUS
andFURIES;
devils,
and
torrents
of
fire
and
brimstone.It
is
true,
both
fear
and
hope
enter
into
religion;
because
both
thesepassions,
at
different
times,
agitate
the
human
mind,
and
each
of
themforms
a
species
of
divinity
suitable
to
itself.
But
when
a
man
is
in
acheerful
disposition,
he
is
fit
for
business,
or
company,
orentertainment
of
any
kind;
and
he
naturally
applies
himself
to
these,
andthinks
not
of
religion.
When
melancholy
and
dejected,
he
has
nothing
todo
but
brood
upon
the
terrors
of
the
invisible
world,
and
to
plungehimself
still
deeper
in
affliction.
It
may
indeed
happen,
that
after
hehas,
in
this
manner,
engraved
the
religious
opinions
deep
into
histhought
and
imagination,
there
may
arrive
a
change
of
health
orcircumstances,
which
may
restore
his
good
humour,
and
raising
cheerfulprospects
of
futurity,
make
him
run
into
the
other
extreme
of
joy
andtriumph.
But
still
it
must
be
acknowledged,
that,
as
terror
is
theprimary
principle
of
religion,
it
is
the
passion
which
alwayspredominates
in
it,
and
admits
but
of
short
intervals
of
pleasure.Not
to
mention,
that
these
fits
of
excessive,
enthusiastic
joy,
byexhausting
the
spirits,
always
prepare
the
way
for
equal
fits
ofsuperstitious
terror
and
dejection;
nor
is
there
any
state
of
mind
sohappy
as
the
calm
and
equable.
But
this
state
it
is
impossible
tosupport,
where
a
man
thinks
that
he
lies
in
such
profound
darkness
anduncertainty,
between
an
eternity
of
happiness
and
an
eternity
of
misery.No
wonder
that
such
an
opinion
disjoints
the
ordinary
frame
of
the
mind,and
throws
it
into
the
utmost
confusion.
And
though
that
opinion
isseldom
so
steady
in
its
operation
as
to
influence
all
the
actions;
yet
itis
apt
to
make
a
considerable
breach
in
the
temper,
and
to
produce
thatgloom
and
melancholy
so
remarkable
in
all
devout
people.It
is
contrary
to
common
sense
to
entertain
apprehensions
or
terrors
uponaccount
of
any
opinion
whatsoever,
or
to
imagine
that
we
run
any
riskhereafter,
by
the
freest
use
of
our
reason.
Such
a
sentiment
implies
bothan
absurdity
and
an
inconsistency.
It
is
an
absurdity
to
believe
that
theDeity
has
human
passions,
and
one
of
the
lowest
of
human
passions,
arestless
appetite
for
applause.
It
is
an
inconsistency
to
believe,
that,since
the
Deity
has
this
human
passion,
he
has
not
others
also;
and,
inparticular,
a
disregard
to
the
opinions
of
creatures
so
much
inferior.To
know
God,
says
SENECA,
is
to
worship
him.
All
other
worship
is
indeedabsurd,
superstitious,
and
even
impious.
It
degrades
him
to
the
lowcondition
of
mankind,
who
are
delighted
with
entreaty,
solicitation,presents,
and
flattery.
Yet
is
this
impiety
the
smallest
of
whichsuperstition
is
guilty.
Commonly,
it
depresses
the
Deity
far
below
thecondition
of
mankind;
and
represents
him
as
a
capricious
DEMON,
whoexercises
his
power
without
reason
and
without
humanity!
And
were
thatDivine
Being
disposed
to
be
offended
at
the
vices
and
follies
of
sillymortals,
who
are
his
own
workmanship,
ill
would
it
surely
fare
with
thevotaries
of
most
popular
superstitions.
Nor
would
any
of
human
race
merithis
favour,
but
a
very
few,
the
philosophical
Theists,
who
entertain,
orrather
indeed
endeavour
to
entertain,
suitable
notions
of
his
Divineperfections:
As
the
only
persons
entitled
to
his
compassion
andindulgence
would
be
the
philosophical
Sceptics,
a
sect
almost
equallyrare,
who,
from
a
natural
diffidence
of
their
own
capacity,
suspend,
orendeavour
to
suspend,
all
judgement
with
regard
to
such
sublime
and
suchextraordinary
subjects.If
the
whole
of
Natural
Theology,
as
some
people
seem
to
maintain,resolves
itself
into
one
simple,
though
somewhat
ambiguous,
at
leastundefined
proposition,
That
the
cause
or
causes
of
order
in
the
universeprobably
bear
some
remote
analogy
to
human
intelligence:
If
thisproposition
be
not
capable
of
extension,
variation,
or
more
particularexplication:
If
it
affords
no
inference
that
affects
human
life,
or
canbe
the
source
of
any
action
or
forbearance:
And
if
the
analogy,
imperfectas
it
is,
can
be
carried
no
further
than
to
the
human
intelligence,
andcannot
be
transferred,
with
any
appearance
of
probability,
to
the
otherqualities
of
the
mind;
if
this
really
be
the
case,
what
can
the
mostinquisitive,
contemplative,
and
religious
man
do
more
than
give
a
plain,philosophical
assent
to
the
proposition,
as
often
as
it
occurs,
andbelieve
that
the
arguments
on
which
it
is
established
exceed
theobjections
which
lie
against
it?
Some
astonishment,
indeed,
willnaturally
arise
from
the
greatness
of
the
object;
some
melancholy
fromits
obscurity;
some
contempt
of
human
reason,
that
it
can
give
nosolution
more
satisfactory
with
regard
to
so
extraordinary
andmagnificent
a
question.
But
believe
me,
CLEANTHES,
the
most
naturalsentiment
which
a
well-disposed
mind
will
feel
on
this
occasion,
is
alonging
desire
and
expectation
that
Heaven
would
be
pleased
to
dissipate,at
least
alleviate,
this
profound
ignorance,
by
affording
some
moreparticular
revelation
to
mankind,
and
making
discoveries
of
the
nature,attributes,
and
operations
of
the
Divine
object
of
our
faith.
A
person,seasoned
with
a
just
sense
of
the
imperfections
of
natural
reason,
willfly
to
revealed
truth
with
the
greatest
avidity:
While
the
haughtyDogmatist,
persuaded
that
he
can
erect
a
complete
system
of
Theology
bythe
mere
help
of
philosophy,
disdains
any
further
aid,
and
rejects
thisadventitious
instructor.
To
be
a
philosophical
Sceptic
is,
in
a
man
ofletters,
the
first
and
most
essential
step
towards
being
a
sound,believing
Christian;
a
proposition
which
I
would
willingly
recommend
tothe
attention
of
PAMPHILUS:
And
I
hope
CLEANTHES
will
forgive
me
forinterposing
so
far
in
the
education
and
instruction
of
his
pupil.CLEANTHES
and
PHILO
pursued
not
this
conversation
much
further:
and
asnothing
ever
made
greater
impression
on
me,
than
all
the
reasonings
ofthat
day,
so
I
confess,
that,
upon
a
serious
review
of
the
whole,
Icannot
but
think,
that
PHILO's
principles
are
more
probable
than
DEMEA's;but
that
those
of
CLEANTHES
approach
still
nearer
to
the
truth.
