Dialogues Concerning Natural ReligionbyDavid 
HumePAMPHILUS TO HERMIPPUSIt has been remarke
d, my HERMIPPUS, that though the ancient phil
osophersconveyed most of their instruction in
 the form of dialogue, this methodof composit
ion has been little practised in later ages, 
and has seldomsucceeded in the hands of those
 who have attempted it. Accurate andregular a
rgument, indeed, such as is now expected of p
hilosophicalinquirers, naturally throws a man
 into the methodical and didacticmanner; wher
e he can immediately, without preparation, ex
plain the pointat which he aims; and thence p
roceed, without interruption, to deducethe pr
oofs on which it is established. To deliver a
 SYSTEM inconversation, scarcely appears natu
ral; and while the dialogue-writerdesires, by
 departing from the direct style of compositi
on, to give afreer air to his performance, an
d avoid the appearance of Author andReader, h
e is apt to run into a worse inconvenience, a
nd convey theimage of Pedagogue and Pupil. Or
, if he carries on the dispute in thenatural 
spirit of good company, by throwing in a vari
ety of topics, andpreserving a proper balance
 among the speakers, he often loses so muchti
me in preparations and transitions, that the 
reader will scarcelythink himself compensated
, by all the graces of dialogue, for the orde
r,brevity, and precision, which are sacrifice
d to them.There are some subjects, however, t
o which dialogue-writing is peculiarlyadapted
, and where it is still preferable to the dir
ect and simple methodof composition.Any point
 of doctrine, which is so obvious that it sca
rcely admits ofdispute, but at the same time 
so important that it cannot be too oftenincul
cated, seems to require some such method of h
andling it; where thenovelty of the manner ma
y compensate the triteness of the subject; wh
erethe vivacity of conversation may enforce t
he precept; and where thevariety of lights, p
resented by various personages and characters
, mayappear neither tedious nor redundant.Any
 question of philosophy, on the other hand, w
hich is so OBSCURE andUNCERTAIN, that human r
eason can reach no fixed determination with r
egardto it; if it should be treated at all, s
eems to lead us naturally intothe style of di
alogue and conversation. Reasonable men may b
e allowed todiffer, where no one can reasonab
ly be positive. Opposite sentiments,even with
out any decision, afford an agreeable amuseme
nt; and if thesubject be curious and interest
ing, the book carries us, in a manner,into co
mpany; and unites the two greatest and purest
 pleasures of humanlife, study and society.Ha
ppily, these circumstances are all to be foun
d in the subject ofNATURAL RELIGION. What tru
th so obvious, so certain, as the being of aG
od, which the most ignorant ages have acknowl
edged, for which the mostrefined geniuses hav
e ambitiously striven to produce new proofs a
ndarguments? What truth so important as this,
 which is the ground of allour hopes, the sur
est foundation of morality, the firmest suppo
rt ofsociety, and the only principle which ou
ght never to be a moment absentfrom our thoug
hts and meditations? But, in treating of this
 obvious andimportant truth, what obscure que
stions occur concerning the nature ofthat Div
ine Being, his attributes, his decrees, his p
lan of providence?These have been always subj
ected to the disputations of men; concerningt
hese human reason has not reached any certain
 determination. But theseare topics so intere
sting, that we cannot restrain our restless i
nquirywith regard to them; though nothing but
 doubt, uncertainty, andcontradiction, have a
s yet been the result of our most accurateres
earches.This I had lately occasion to observe
, while I passed, as usual, part ofthe summer
 season with CLEANTHES, and was present at th
ose conversationsof his with PHILO and DEMEA,
 of which I gave you lately some imperfectacc
ount. Your curiosity, you then told me, was s
o excited, that I must,of necessity, enter in
to a more exact detail of their reasonings, a
nddisplay those various systems which they ad
vanced with regard to sodelicate a subject as
 that of natural religion. The remarkable con
trastin their characters still further raised
 your expectations; while youopposed the accu
rate philosophical turn of CLEANTHES to the c
arelessscepticism of PHILO, or compared eithe
r of their dispositions with therigid inflexi
ble orthodoxy of DEMEA. My youth rendered me 
a mere auditorof their disputes; and that cur
iosity, natural to the early season oflife, h
as so deeply imprinted in my memory the whole
 chain and connectionof their arguments, that
, I hope, I shall not omit or confound anycon
siderable part of them in the recital.PART 1A
fter I joined the company, whom I found sitti
ng in CLEANTHES's library,DEMEA paid CLEANTHE
S some compliments on the great care which he
 took ofmy education, and on his unwearied pe
rseverance and constancy in all hisfriendship
s. The father of PAMPHILUS, said he, was your
 intimate friend:The son is your pupil; and m
ay indeed be regarded as your adopted son,wer
e we to judge by the pains which you bestow i
n conveying to him everyuseful branch of lite
rature and science. You are no more wanting, 
I ampersuaded, in prudence, than in industry.
 I shall, therefore, communicateto you a maxi
m, which I have observed with regard to my ow
n children,that I may learn how far it agrees
 with your practice. The method Ifollow in th
eir education is founded on the saying of an 
ancient, "Thatstudents of philosophy ought fi
rst to learn logics, then ethics, nextphysics
, last of all the nature of the gods." [Chrys
ippus apud Plut: derepug: Stoicorum] This sci
ence of natural theology, according to him,be
ing the most profound and abstruse of any, re
quired the maturestjudgement in its students;
 and none but a mind enriched with all the ot
hersciences, can safely be entrusted with it.
Are you so late, says PHILO, in teaching your
 children the principles ofreligion? Is there
 no danger of their neglecting, or rejecting 
altogetherthose opinions of which they have h
eard so little during the whole courseof thei
r education? It is only as a science, replied
 DEMEA, subjected tohuman reasoning and dispu
tation, that I postpone the study of NaturalT
heology. To season their minds with early pie
ty, is my chief care; andby continual precept
 and instruction, and I hope too by example, 
Iimprint deeply on their tender minds an habi
tual reverence for all theprinciples of relig
ion. While they pass through every other scie
nce, Istill remark the uncertainty of each pa
rt; the eternal disputations ofmen; the obscu
rity of all philosophy; and the strange, ridi
culousconclusions, which some of the greatest
 geniuses have derived from theprinciples of 
mere human reason. Having thus tamed their mi
nd to a propersubmission and self-diffidence,
 I have no longer any scruple of openingto th
em the greatest mysteries of religion; nor ap
prehend any danger fromthat assuming arroganc
e of philosophy, which may lead them to rejec
t themost established doctrines and opinions.
Your precaution, says PHILO, of seasoning you
r children's minds earlywith piety, is certai
nly very reasonable; and no more than is requ
isitein this profane and irreligious age. But
 what I chiefly admire in yourplan of educati
on, is your method of drawing advantage from 
the veryprinciples of philosophy and learning
, which, by inspiring pride andself-sufficien
cy, have commonly, in all ages, been found so
 destructiveto the principles of religion. Th
e vulgar, indeed, we may remark, who areunacq
uainted with science and profound inquiry, ob
serving the endlessdisputes of the learned, h
ave commonly a thorough contempt forphilosoph
y; and rivet themselves the faster, by that m
eans, in the greatpoints of theology which ha
ve been taught them. Those who enter a little
into study and inquiry, finding many appearan
ces of evidence indoctrines the newest and mo
st extraordinary, think nothing too difficult
for human reason; and, presumptuously breakin
g through all fences,profane the inmost sanct
uaries of the temple. But CLEANTHES will, I h
ope,agree with me, that, after we have abando
ned ignorance, the surestremedy, there is sti
ll one expedient left to prevent this profane
liberty. Let DEMEA's principles be improved a
nd cultivated: Let us becomethoroughly sensib
le of the weakness, blindness, and narrow lim
its ofhuman reason: Let us duly consider its 
uncertainty and endlesscontrarieties, even in
 subjects of common life and practice: Let th
eerrors and deceits of our very senses be set
 before us; the insuperabledifficulties which
 attend first principles in all systems; thec
ontradictions which adhere to the very ideas 
of matter, cause andeffect, extension, space,
 time, motion; and in a word, quantity of all
kinds, the object of the only science that ca
n fairly pretend to anycertainty or evidence.
 When these topics are displayed in their ful
llight, as they are by some philosophers and 
almost all divines; who canretain such confid
ence in this frail faculty of reason as to pa
y anyregard to its determinations in points s
o sublime, so abstruse, so remotefrom common 
life and experience? When the coherence of th
e parts of astone, or even that composition o
f parts which renders it extended; whenthese 
familiar objects, I say, are so inexplicable,
 and containcircumstances so repugnant and co
ntradictory; with what assurance can wedecide
 concerning the origin of worlds, or trace th
eir history frometernity to eternity?While PH
ILO pronounced these words, I could observe a
 smile in thecountenance both of DEMEA and CL
EANTHES. That of DEMEA seemed to imply anunre
served satisfaction in the doctrines delivere
d: But, in CLEANTHES'sfeatures, I could disti
nguish an air of finesse; as if he perceived 
someraillery or artificial malice in the reas
onings of PHILO.You propose then, PHILO, said
 CLEANTHES, to erect religious faith onphilos
ophical scepticism; and you think, that if ce
rtainty or evidence beexpelled from every oth
er subject of inquiry, it will all retire to 
thesetheological doctrines, and there acquire
 a superior force and authority.Whether your 
scepticism be as absolute and sincere as you 
pretend, weshall learn by and by, when the co
mpany breaks up: We shall then see,whether yo
u go out at the door or the window; and wheth
er you reallydoubt if your body has gravity, 
or can be injured by its fall; accordingto po
pular opinion, derived from our fallacious se
nses, and morefallacious experience. And this
 consideration, DEMEA, may, I think,fairly se
rve to abate our ill-will to this humorous se
ct of the sceptics.If they be thoroughly in e
arnest, they will not long trouble the worldw
ith their doubts, cavils, and disputes: If th
ey be only in jest, theyare, perhaps, bad rai
llers; but can never be very dangerous, eithe
r tothe state, to philosophy, or to religion.
In reality, PHILO, continued he, it seems cer
tain, that though a man, ina flush of humour,
 after intense reflection on the many contrad
ictionsand imperfections of human reason, may
 entirely renounce all belief andopinion, it 
is impossible for him to persevere in this to
tal scepticism,or make it appear in his condu
ct for a few hours. External objects pressin 
upon him; passions solicit him; his philosoph
ical melancholydissipates; and even the utmos
t violence upon his own temper will not beabl
e, during any time, to preserve the poor appe
arance of scepticism. Andfor what reason impo
se on himself such a violence? This is a poin
t inwhich it will be impossible for him ever 
to satisfy himself, consistentlywith his scep
tical principles. So that, upon the whole, no
thing could bemore ridiculous than the princi
ples of the ancient PYRRHONIANS; if inreality
 they endeavoured, as is pretended, to extend
, throughout, thesame scepticism which they h
ad learned from the declamations of theirscho
ols, and which they ought to have confined to
 them.In this view, there appears a great res
emblance between the sects of theSTOICS and P
YRRHONIANS, though perpetual antagonists; and
 both of themseem founded on this erroneous m
axim, That what a man can performsometimes, a
nd in some dispositions, he can perform alway
s, and in everydisposition. When the mind, by
 Stoical reflections, is elevated into asubli
me enthusiasm of virtue, and strongly smit wi
th any species ofhonour or public good, the u
tmost bodily pain and sufferings will notprev
ail over such a high sense of duty; and it is
 possible, perhaps, byits means, even to smil
e and exult in the midst of tortures. If this
sometimes may be the case in fact and reality
, much more may aphilosopher, in his school, 
or even in his closet, work himself up tosuch
 an enthusiasm, and support in imagination th
e acutest pain or mostcalamitous event which 
he can possibly conceive. But how shall he su
pportthis enthusiasm itself? The bent of his 
mind relaxes, and cannot berecalled at pleasu
re; avocations lead him astray; misfortunes a
ttack himunawares; and the philosopher sinks 
by degrees into the plebeian.I allow of your 
comparison between the STOICS and SKEPTICS, r
epliedPHILO. But you may observe, at the same
 time, that though the mindcannot, in Stoicis
m, support the highest flights of philosophy,
 yet, evenwhen it sinks lower, it still retai
ns somewhat of its former disposition;and the
 effects of the Stoic's reasoning will appear
 in his conduct incommon life, and through th
e whole tenor of his actions. The ancientscho
ols, particularly that of ZENO, produced exam
ples of virtue andconstancy which seem astoni
shing to present times.    Vain Wisdom all an
d false Philosophy.    Yet with a pleasing so
rcery could charm    Pain, for a while, or an
guish; and excite    Fallacious Hope, or arm 
the obdurate breast    With stubborn Patience
, as with triple steel.In like manner, if a m
an has accustomed himself to scepticalconside
rations on the uncertainty and narrow limits 
of reason, he willnot entirely forget them wh
en he turns his reflection on other subjects;
but in all his philosophical principles and r
easoning, I dare not say inhis common conduct
, he will be found different from those, who 
eithernever formed any opinions in the case, 
or have entertained sentimentsmore favourable
 to human reason.To whatever length any one m
ay push his speculative principles ofsceptici
sm, he must act, I own, and live, and convers
e, like other men;and for this conduct he is 
not obliged to give any other reason, than th
eabsolute necessity he lies under of so doing
. If he ever carries hisspeculations further 
than this necessity constrains him, andphilos
ophises either on natural or moral subjects, 
he is allured by acertain pleasure and satisf
action which he finds in employing himselfaft
er that manner. He considers besides, that ev
ery one, even in commonlife, is constrained t
o have more or less of this philosophy; that 
fromour earliest infancy we make continual ad
vances in forming more generalprinciples of c
onduct and reasoning; that the larger experie
nce weacquire, and the stronger reason we are
 endued with, we always render ourprinciples 
the more general and comprehensive; and that 
what we callphilosophy is nothing but a more 
regular and methodical operation of thesame k
ind. To philosophise on such subjects, is not
hing essentiallydifferent from reasoning on c
ommon life; and we may only expect greatersta
bility, if not greater truth, from our philos
ophy, on account of itsexacter and more scrup
ulous method of proceeding.But when we look b
eyond human affairs and the properties of the
surrounding bodies: when we carry our specula
tions into the twoeternities, before and afte
r the present state of things; into thecreati
on and formation of the universe; the existen
ce and properties ofspirits; the powers and o
perations of one universal Spirit existingwit
hout beginning and without end; omnipotent, o
mniscient, immutable,infinite, and incomprehe
nsible: We must be far removed from the small
esttendency to scepticism not to be apprehens
ive, that we have here gotquite beyond the re
ach of our faculties. So long as we confine o
urspeculations to trade, or morals, or politi
cs, or criticism, we makeappeals, every momen
t, to common sense and experience, which stre
ngthenour philosophical conclusions, and remo
ve, at least in part, thesuspicion which we s
o justly entertain with regard to every reaso
ningthat is very subtle and refined. But, in 
theological reasonings, we havenot this advan
tage; while, at the same time, we are employe
d uponobjects, which, we must be sensible, ar
e too large for our grasp, and ofall others, 
require most to be familiarised to our appreh
ension. We arelike foreigners in a strange co
untry, to whom every thing must seemsuspiciou
s, and who are in danger every moment of tran
sgressing againstthe laws and customs of the 
people with whom they live and converse. Wekn
ow not how far we ought to trust our vulgar m
ethods of reasoning insuch a subject; since, 
even in common life, and in that province whi
ch ispeculiarly appropriated to them, we cann
ot account for them, and areentirely guided b
y a kind of instinct or necessity in employin
g them.All sceptics pretend, that, if reason 
be considered in an abstract view,it furnishe
s invincible arguments against itself; and th
at we could neverretain any conviction or ass
urance, on any subject, were not thesceptical
 reasonings so refined and subtle, that they 
are not able tocounterpoise the more solid an
d more natural arguments derived from thesens
es and experience. But it is evident, wheneve
r our arguments losethis advantage, and run w
ide of common life, that the most refinedscep
ticism comes to be upon a footing with them, 
and is able to opposeand counterbalance them.
 The one has no more weight than the other. T
hemind must remain in suspense between them; 
and it is that very suspenseor balance, which
 is the triumph of scepticism.But I observe, 
says CLEANTHES, with regard to you, PHILO, an
d allspeculative sceptics, that your doctrine
 and practice are as much atvariance in the m
ost abstruse points of theory as in the condu
ct ofcommon life. Wherever evidence discovers
 itself, you adhere to it,notwithstanding you
r pretended scepticism; and I can observe, to
o, someof your sect to be as decisive as thos
e who make greater professions ofcertainty an
d assurance. In reality, would not a man be r
idiculous, whopretended to reject NEWTON's ex
plication of the wonderful phenomenon ofthe r
ainbow, because that explication gives a minu
te anatomy of the raysof light; a subject, fo
rsooth, too refined for human comprehension? 
Andwhat would you say to one, who, having not
hing particular to object tothe arguments of 
COPERNICUS and GALILEO for the motion of the 
earth,should withhold his assent, on that gen
eral principle, that thesesubjects were too m
agnificent and remote to be explained by the 
narrowand fallacious reason of mankind?There 
is indeed a kind of brutish and ignorant scep
ticism, as you wellobserved, which gives the 
vulgar a general prejudice against what they 
donot easily understand, and makes them rejec
t every principle whichrequires elaborate rea
soning to prove and establish it. This specie
s ofscepticism is fatal to knowledge, not to 
religion; since we find, thatthose who make g
reatest profession of it, give often their as
sent, notonly to the great truths of Theism a
nd natural theology, but even to themost absu
rd tenets which a traditional superstition ha
s recommended tothem. They firmly believe in 
witches, though they will not believe noratte
nd to the most simple proposition of Euclid. 
But the refined andphilosophical sceptics fal
l into an inconsistence of an opposite nature
.They push their researches into the most abs
truse corners of science; andtheir assent att
ends them in every step, proportioned to the 
evidencewhich they meet with. They are even o
bliged to acknowledge, that the mostabstruse 
and remote objects are those which are best e
xplained byphilosophy. Light is in reality an
atomised. The true system of theheavenly bodi
es is discovered and ascertained. But the nou
rishment ofbodies by food is still an inexpli
cable mystery. The cohesion of theparts of ma
tter is still incomprehensible. These sceptic
s, therefore, areobliged, in every question, 
to consider each particular evidence apart,an
d proportion their assent to the precise degr
ee of evidence whichoccurs. This is their pra
ctice in all natural, mathematical, moral, an
dpolitical science. And why not the same, I a
sk, in the theological andreligious? Why must
 conclusions of this nature be alone rejected
 on thegeneral presumption of the insufficien
cy of human reason, without anyparticular dis
cussion of the evidence? Is not such an unequ
al conduct aplain proof of prejudice and pass
ion?Our senses, you say, are fallacious; our 
understanding erroneous; ourideas, even of th
e most familiar objects, extension, duration,
 motion,full of absurdities and contradiction
s. You defy me to solve thedifficulties, or r
econcile the repugnancies which you discover 
in them. Ihave not capacity for so great an u
ndertaking: I have not leisure for it:I perce
ive it to be superfluous. Your own conduct, i
n every circumstance,refutes your principles,
 and shows the firmest reliance on all therec
eived maxims of science, morals, prudence, an
d behaviour.I shall never assent to so harsh 
an opinion as that of a celebratedwriter [L'A
rte de penser], who says, that the Sceptics a
re not a sect ofphilosophers: They are only a
 sect of liars. I may, however, affirm(I hope
 without offence), that they are a sect of je
sters or raillers.But for my part, whenever I
 find myself disposed to mirth and amusement,
I shall certainly choose my entertainment of 
a less perplexing and abstrusenature. A comed
y, a novel, or at most a history, seems a mor
e naturalrecreation than such metaphysical su
btleties and abstractions.In vain would the s
ceptic make a distinction between science and
 commonlife, or between one science and anoth
er. The arguments employed in all,if just, ar
e of a similar nature, and contain the same f
orce andevidence. Or if there be any differen
ce among them, the advantage liesentirely on 
the side of theology and natural religion. Ma
ny principles ofmechanics are founded on very
 abstruse reasoning; yet no man who has anypr
etensions to science, even no speculative sce
ptic, pretends toentertain the least doubt wi
th regard to them. The COPERNICAN systemconta
ins the most surprising paradox, and the most
 contrary to ournatural conceptions, to appea
rances, and to our very senses: yet evenmonks
 and inquisitors are now constrained to withd
raw their opposition toit. And shall PHILO, a
 man of so liberal a genius and extensiveknow
ledge, entertain any general undistinguished 
scruples with regard tothe religious hypothes
is, which is founded on the simplest and most
obvious arguments, and, unless it meets with 
artificial obstacles, hassuch easy access and
 admission into the mind of man?And here we m
ay observe, continued he, turning himself tow
ards DEMEA, apretty curious circumstance in t
he history of the sciences. After theunion of
 philosophy with the popular religion, upon t
he firstestablishment of Christianity, nothin
g was more usual, among allreligious teachers
, than declamations against reason, against t
he senses,against every principle derived mer
ely from human research and inquiry.All the t
opics of the ancient academics were adopted b
y the fathers; andthence propagated for sever
al ages in every school and pulpit throughout
Christendom. The Reformers embraced the same 
principles of reasoning, orrather declamation
; and all panegyrics on the excellency of fai
th, weresure to be interlarded with some seve
re strokes of satire against naturalreason. A
 celebrated prelate [Monsr. Huet] too, of the
 Romish communion,a man of the most extensive
 learning, who wrote a demonstration ofChrist
ianity, has also composed a treatise, which c
ontains all the cavilsof the boldest and most
 determined PYRRHONISM. LOCKE seems to have b
een thefirst Christian who ventured openly to
 assert, that faith was nothing buta species 
of reason; that religion was only a branch of
 philosophy; andthat a chain of arguments, si
milar to that which established any truth inm
orals, politics, or physics, was always emplo
yed in discovering all theprinciples of theol
ogy, natural and revealed. The ill use which 
BAYLE andother libertines made of the philoso
phical scepticism of the fathers andfirst ref
ormers, still further propagated the judiciou
s sentiment of Mr.LOCKE: And it is now in a m
anner avowed, by all pretenders to reasoninga
nd philosophy, that Atheist and Sceptic are a
lmost synonymous. And as itis certain that no
 man is in earnest when he professes the latt
erprinciple, I would fain hope that there are
 as few who seriously maintainthe former.Don'
t you remember, said PHILO, the excellent say
ing of LORD BACON onthis head? That a little 
philosophy, replied CLEANTHES, makes a man an
Atheist: A great deal converts him to religio
n. That is a very judiciousremark too, said P
HILO. But what I have in my eye is another pa
ssage,where, having mentioned DAVID's fool, w
ho said in his heart there is noGod, this gre
at philosopher observes, that the Atheists no
wadays have adouble share of folly; for they 
are not contented to say in their heartsthere
 is no God, but they also utter that impiety 
with their lips, andare thereby guilty of mul
tiplied indiscretion and imprudence. Suchpeop
le, though they were ever so much in earnest,
 cannot, methinks, bevery formidable.But thou
gh you should rank me in this class of fools,
 I cannot forbearcommunicating a remark that 
occurs to me, from the history of thereligiou
s and irreligious scepticism with which you h
ave entertained us.It appears to me, that the
re are strong symptoms of priestcraft in thew
hole progress of this affair. During ignorant
 ages, such as those whichfollowed the dissol
ution of the ancient schools, the priests per
ceived,that Atheism, Deism, or heresy of any 
kind, could only proceed from thepresumptuous
 questioning of received opinions, and from a
 belief thathuman reason was equal to every t
hing. Education had then a mightyinfluence ov
er the minds of men, and was almost equal in 
force to thosesuggestions of the senses and c
ommon understanding, by which the mostdetermi
ned sceptic must allow himself to be governed
. But at present,when the influence of educat
ion is much diminished, and men, from a moreo
pen commerce of the world, have learned to co
mpare the popularprinciples of different nati
ons and ages, our sagacious divines havechang
ed their whole system of philosophy, and talk
 the language ofSTOICS, PLATONISTS, and PERIP
ATETICS, not that of PYRRHONIANS andACADEMICS
. If we distrust human reason, we have now no
 other principle tolead us into religion. Thu
s, sceptics in one age, dogmatists in another
;whichever system best suits the purpose of t
hese reverend gentlemen, ingiving them an asc
endant over mankind, they are sure to make it
 theirfavourite principle, and established te
net.It is very natural, said CLEANTHES, for m
en to embrace those principles,by which they 
find they can best defend their doctrines; no
r need we haveany recourse to priestcraft to 
account for so reasonable an expedient.And, s
urely nothing can afford a stronger presumpti
on, that any set ofprinciples are true, and o
ught to be embraced, than to observe that the
ytend to the confirmation of true religion, a
nd serve to confound thecavils of Atheists, L
ibertines, and Freethinkers of all denominati
ons.PART 2I must own, CLEANTHES, said DEMEA, 
that nothing can more surprise me,than the li
ght in which you have all along put this argu
ment. By thewhole tenor of your discourse, on
e would imagine that you weremaintaining the 
Being of a God, against the cavils of Atheist
s andInfidels; and were necessitated to becom
e a champion for that fundamentalprinciple of
 all religion. But this, I hope, is not by an
y means aquestion among us. No man, no man at
 least of common sense, I ampersuaded, ever e
ntertained a serious doubt with regard to a t
ruth socertain and self-evident. The question
 is not concerning the being, butthe nature o
f God. This, I affirm, from the infirmities o
f humanunderstanding, to be altogether incomp
rehensible and unknown to us. Theessence of t
hat supreme Mind, his attributes, the manner 
of hisexistence, the very nature of his durat
ion; these, and every particularwhich regards
 so divine a Being, are mysterious to men. Fi
nite, weak, andblind creatures, we ought to h
umble ourselves in his august presence;and, c
onscious of our frailties, adore in silence h
is infiniteperfections, which eye hath not se
en, ear hath not heard, neither hath itentere
d into the heart of man to conceive. They are
 covered in a deepcloud from human curiosity.
 It is profaneness to attempt penetratingthro
ugh these sacred obscurities. And, next to th
e impiety of denying hisexistence, is the tem
erity of prying into his nature and essence, 
decreesand attributes.But lest you should thi
nk that my piety has here got the better of m
yphilosophy, I shall support my opinion, if i
t needs any support, by a verygreat authority
. I might cite all the divines, almost, from 
the foundationof Christianity, who have ever 
treated of this or any other theologicalsubje
ct: But I shall confine myself, at present, t
o one equally celebratedfor piety and philoso
phy. It is Father MALEBRANCHE, who, I remembe
r, thusexpresses himself [Recherche de la Ver
ite. Liv. 3. Chap.9]. "One ought notso much,"
 says he, "to call God a spirit, in order to 
express positivelywhat he is, as in order to 
signify that he is not matter. He is a Beingi
nfinitely perfect: Of this we cannot doubt. B
ut in the same manner aswe ought not to imagi
ne, even supposing him corporeal, that he is 
clothedwith a human body, as the ANTHROPOMORP
HITES asserted, under colour thatthat figure 
was the most perfect of any; so, neither ough
t we to imaginethat the spirit of God has hum
an ideas, or bears any resemblance to ourspir
it, under colour that we know nothing more pe
rfect than a human mind.We ought rather to be
lieve, that as he comprehends the perfections
 ofmatter without being material.... he compr
ehends also the perfections ofcreated spirits
 without being spirit, in the manner we conce
ive spirit:That his true name is, He that is;
 or, in other words, Being withoutrestriction
, All Being, the Being infinite and universal
."After so great an authority, DEMEA, replied
 PHILO, as that which you haveproduced, and a
 thousand more which you might produce, it wo
uld appearridiculous in me to add my sentimen
t, or express my approbation of yourdoctrine.
 But surely, where reasonable men treat these
 subjects, thequestion can never be concernin
g the Being, but only the Nature, of theDeity
. The former truth, as you well observe, is u
nquestionable andself-evident. Nothing exists
 without a cause; and the original cause ofth
is universe (whatever it be) we call God; and
 piously ascribe to himevery species of perfe
ction. Whoever scruples this fundamental trut
h,deserves every punishment which can be infl
icted among philosophers, towit, the greatest
 ridicule, contempt, and disapprobation. But 
as allperfection is entirely relative, we oug
ht never to imagine that wecomprehend the att
ributes of this divine Being, or to suppose t
hat hisperfections have any analogy or likene
ss to the perfections of a humancreature. Wis
dom, Thought, Design, Knowledge; these we jus
tly ascribe tohim; because these words are ho
nourable among men, and we have no otherlangu
age or other conceptions by which we can expr
ess our adoration ofhim. But let us beware, l
est we think that our ideas anywise correspon
dto his perfections, or that his attributes h
ave any resemblance to thesequalities among m
en. He is infinitely superior to our limited 
view andcomprehension; and is more the object
 of worship in the temple, than ofdisputation
 in the schools.In reality, CLEANTHES, contin
ued he, there is no need of having recourseto
 that affected scepticism so displeasing to y
ou, in order to come atthis determination. Ou
r ideas reach no further than our experience.
 Wehave no experience of divine attributes an
d operations. I need notconclude my syllogism
. You can draw the inference yourself. And it
 is apleasure to me (and I hope to you too) t
hat just reasoning and soundpiety here concur
 in the same conclusion, and both of them est
ablish theadorably mysterious and incomprehen
sible nature of the Supreme Being.Not to lose
 any time in circumlocutions, said CLEANTHES,
 addressinghimself to DEMEA, much less in rep
lying to the pious declamations ofPHILO; I sh
all briefly explain how I conceive this matte
r. Look round theworld: contemplate the whole
 and every part of it: You will find it to be
nothing but one great machine, subdivided int
o an infinite number oflesser machines, which
 again admit of subdivisions to a degree beyo
ndwhat human senses and faculties can trace a
nd explain. All these variousmachines, and ev
en their most minute parts, are adjusted to e
ach otherwith an accuracy which ravishes into
 admiration all men who have evercontemplated
 them. The curious adapting of means to ends,
 throughout allnature, resembles exactly, tho
ugh it much exceeds, the productions ofhuman 
contrivance; of human designs, thought, wisdo
m, and intelligence.Since, therefore, the eff
ects resemble each other, we are led to infer
,by all the rules of analogy, that the causes
 also resemble; and that theAuthor of Nature 
is somewhat similar to the mind of man, thoug
h possessedof much larger faculties, proporti
oned to the grandeur of the work whichhe has 
executed. By this argument a posteriori, and 
by this argumentalone, do we prove at once th
e existence of a Deity, and his similarityto 
human mind and intelligence.I shall be so fre
e, CLEANTHES, said DEMEA, as to tell you, tha
t from thebeginning, I could not approve of y
our conclusion concerning thesimilarity of th
e Deity to men; still less can I approve of t
he mediumsby which you endeavour to establish
 it. What! No demonstration of theBeing of Go
d! No abstract arguments! No proofs a priori!
 Are these, whichhave hitherto been so much i
nsisted on by philosophers, all fallacy, alls
ophism? Can we reach no further in this subje
ct than experience andprobability? I will not
 say that this is betraying the cause of a De
ity:But surely, by this affected candour, you
 give advantages to Atheists,which they never
 could obtain by the mere dint of argument an
d reasoning.What I chiefly scruple in this su
bject, said PHILO, is not so much thatall rel
igious arguments are by CLEANTHES reduced to 
experience, as thatthey appear not to be even
 the most certain and irrefragable of thatinf
erior kind. That a stone will fall, that fire
 will burn, that theearth has solidity, we ha
ve observed a thousand and a thousand times; 
andwhen any new instance of this nature is pr
esented, we draw withouthesitation the accust
omed inference. The exact similarity of the c
asesgives us a perfect assurance of a similar
 event; and a stronger evidenceis never desir
ed nor sought after. But wherever you depart,
 in the least,from the similarity of the case
s, you diminish proportionably theevidence; a
nd may at last bring it to a very weak analog
y, which isconfessedly liable to error and un
certainty. After having experienced thecircul
ation of the blood in human creatures, we mak
e no doubt that ittakes place in TITIUS and M
AEVIUS. But from its circulation in frogs and
fishes, it is only a presumption, though a st
rong one, from analogy, thatit takes place in
 men and other animals. The analogical reason
ing is muchweaker, when we infer the circulat
ion of the sap in vegetables from ourexperien
ce that the blood circulates in animals; and 
those, who hastilyfollowed that imperfect ana
logy, are found, by more accurate experiments
,to have been mistaken.If we see a house, CLE
ANTHES, we conclude, with the greatest certai
nty,that it had an architect or builder; beca
use this is precisely thatspecies of effect w
hich we have experienced to proceed from that
 speciesof cause. But surely you will not aff
irm, that the universe bears such aresemblanc
e to a house, that we can with the same certa
inty infer asimilar cause, or that the analog
y is here entire and perfect. Thedissimilitud
e is so striking, that the utmost you can her
e pretend to isa guess, a conjecture, a presu
mption concerning a similar cause; and howtha
t pretension will be received in the world, I
 leave you to consider.It would surely be ver
y ill received, replied CLEANTHES; and I shou
ld bedeservedly blamed and detested, did I al
low, that the proofs of a Deityamounted to no
 more than a guess or conjecture. But is the 
wholeadjustment of means to ends in a house a
nd in the universe so slight aresemblance? Th
e economy of final causes? The order, proport
ion, andarrangement of every part? Steps of a
 stair are plainly contrived, thathuman legs 
may use them in mounting; and this inference 
is certain andinfallible. Human legs are also
 contrived for walking and mounting; andthis 
inference, I allow, is not altogether so cert
ain, because of thedissimilarity which you re
mark; but does it, therefore, deserve the nam
eonly of presumption or conjecture?Good God! 
cried DEMEA, interrupting him, where are we? 
Zealous defendersof religion allow, that the 
proofs of a Deity fall short of perfecteviden
ce! And you, PHILO, on whose assistance I dep
ended in proving theadorable mysteriousness o
f the Divine Nature, do you assent to all the
seextravagant opinions of CLEANTHES? For what
 other name can I give them?or, why spare my 
censure, when such principles are advanced, s
upported bysuch an authority, before so young
 a man as PAMPHILUS?You seem not to apprehend
, replied PHILO, that I argue with CLEANTHES 
inhis own way; and, by showing him the danger
ous consequences of histenets, hope at last t
o reduce him to our opinion. But what sticks 
mostwith you, I observe, is the representatio
n which CLEANTHES has made ofthe argument a p
osteriori; and finding that that argument is 
likely toescape your hold and vanish into air
, you think it so disguised, that youcan scar
cely believe it to be set in its true light. 
Now, however much Imay dissent, in other resp
ects, from the dangerous principles ofCLEANTH
ES, I must allow that he has fairly represent
ed that argument; andI shall endeavour so to 
state the matter to you, that you will entert
ainno further scruples with regard to it.Were
 a man to abstract from every thing which he 
knows or has seen, hewould be altogether inca
pable, merely from his own ideas, to determin
ewhat kind of scene the universe must be, or 
to give the preference to onestate or situati
on of things above another. For as nothing wh
ich heclearly conceives could be esteemed imp
ossible or implying a contradiction,every chi
mera of his fancy would be upon an equal foot
ing; nor could heassign any just reason why h
e adheres to one idea or system, and rejectst
he others which are equally possible.Again; a
fter he opens his eyes, and contemplates the 
world as it reallyis, it would be impossible 
for him at first to assign the cause of anyon
e event, much less of the whole of things, or
 of the universe. He mightset his fancy a ram
bling; and she might bring him in an infinite
 varietyof reports and representations. These
 would all be possible; but beingall equally 
possible, he would never of himself give a sa
tisfactoryaccount for his preferring one of t
hem to the rest. Experience alone canpoint ou
t to him the true cause of any phenomenon.Now
, according to this method of reasoning, DEME
A, it follows, (and is,indeed, tacitly allowe
d by CLEANTHES himself,) that order, arrangem
ent,or the adjustment of final causes, is not
 of itself any proof of design;but only so fa
r as it has been experienced to proceed from 
thatprinciple. For aught we can know a priori
, matter may contain the sourceor spring of o
rder originally within itself, as well as min
d does; andthere is no more difficulty in con
ceiving, that the several elements,from an in
ternal unknown cause, may fall into the most 
exquisitearrangement, than to conceive that t
heir ideas, in the great universalmind, from 
a like internal unknown cause, fall into that
 arrangement. Theequal possibility of both th
ese suppositions is allowed. But, byexperienc
e, we find, (according to CLEANTHES), that th
ere is a differencebetween them. Throw severa
l pieces of steel together, without shape orf
orm; they will never arrange themselves so as
 to compose a watch. Stone,and mortar, and wo
od, without an architect, never erect a house
. But theideas in a human mind, we see, by an
 unknown, inexplicable economy,arrange themse
lves so as to form the plan of a watch or hou
se.Experience, therefore, proves, that there 
is an original principle oforder in mind, not
 in matter. From similar effects we infer sim
ilarcauses. The adjustment of means to ends i
s alike in the universe, as in amachine of hu
man contrivance. The causes, therefore, must 
be resembling.I was from the beginning scanda
lised, I must own, with this resemblance,whic
h is asserted, between the Deity and human cr
eatures; and mustconceive it to imply such a 
degradation of the Supreme Being as no soundT
heist could endure. With your assistance, the
refore, DEMEA, I shallendeavour to defend wha
t you justly call the adorable mysteriousness
 ofthe Divine Nature, and shall refute this r
easoning of CLEANTHES, providedhe allows that
 I have made a fair representation of it.When
 CLEANTHES had assented, PHILO, after a short
 pause, proceeded in thefollowing manner.That
 all inferences, CLEANTHES, concerning fact, 
are founded onexperience; and that all experi
mental reasonings are founded on thesuppositi
on that similar causes prove similar effects,
 and similareffects similar causes; I shall n
ot at present much dispute with you. Butobser
ve, I entreat you, with what extreme caution 
all just reasonersproceed in the transferring
 of experiments to similar cases. Unless thec
ases be exactly similar, they repose no perfe
ct confidence in applyingtheir past observati
on to any particular phenomenon. Every altera
tion ofcircumstances occasions a doubt concer
ning the event; and it requires newexperiment
s to prove certainly, that the new circumstan
ces are of nomoment or importance. A change i
n bulk, situation, arrangement, age,dispositi
on of the air, or surrounding bodies; any of 
these particularsmay be attended with the mos
t unexpected consequences: And unless theobje
cts be quite familiar to us, it is the highes
t temerity to expectwith assurance, after any
 of these changes, an event similar to thatwh
ich before fell under our observation. The sl
ow and deliberate steps ofphilosophers here, 
if any where, are distinguished from the prec
ipitatemarch of the vulgar, who, hurried on b
y the smallest similitude, areincapable of al
l discernment or consideration.But can you th
ink, CLEANTHES, that your usual phlegm and ph
ilosophy havebeen preserved in so wide a step
 as you have taken, when you compared tothe u
niverse houses, ships, furniture, machines, a
nd, from theirsimilarity in some circumstance
s, inferred a similarity in their causes?Thou
ght, design, intelligence, such as we discove
r in men and otheranimals, is no more than on
e of the springs and principles of theunivers
e, as well as heat or cold, attraction or rep
ulsion, and a hundredothers, which fall under
 daily observation. It is an active cause, by
which some particular parts of nature, we fin
d, produce alterations onother parts. But can
 a conclusion, with any propriety, be transfe
rredfrom parts to the whole? Does not the gre
at disproportion bar allcomparison and infere
nce? From observing the growth of a hair, can
 welearn any thing concerning the generation 
of a man? Would the manner of aleaf's blowing
, even though perfectly known, afford us any 
instructionconcerning the vegetation of a tre
e?But, allowing that we were to take the oper
ations of one part of natureupon another, for
 the foundation of our judgement concerning t
he originof the whole, (which never can be ad
mitted,) yet why select so minute, soweak, so
 bounded a principle, as the reason and desig
n of animals isfound to be upon this planet? 
What peculiar privilege has this littleagitat
ion of the brain which we call thought, that 
we must thus make itthe model of the whole un
iverse? Our partiality in our own favour does
indeed present it on all occasions; but sound
 philosophy ought carefullyto guard against s
o natural an illusion.So far from admitting, 
continued PHILO, that the operations of a par
t canafford us any just conclusion concerning
 the origin of the whole, I willnot allow any
 one part to form a rule for another part, if
 the latter bevery remote from the former. Is
 there any reasonable ground to conclude,that
 the inhabitants of other planets possess tho
ught, intelligence,reason, or any thing simil
ar to these faculties in men? When nature has
so extremely diversified her manner of operat
ion in this small globe, canwe imagine that s
he incessantly copies herself throughout so i
mmense auniverse? And if thought, as we may w
ell suppose, be confined merely tothis narrow
 corner, and has even there so limited a sphe
re of action,with what propriety can we assig
n it for the original cause of allthings? The
 narrow views of a peasant, who makes his dom
estic economy therule for the government of k
ingdoms, is in comparison a pardonablesophism
.But were we ever so much assured, that a tho
ught and reason, resemblingthe human, were to
 be found throughout the whole universe, and 
were itsactivity elsewhere vastly greater and
 more commanding than it appears inthis globe
; yet I cannot see, why the operations of a w
orld constituted,arranged, adjusted, can with
 any propriety be extended to a world whichis
 in its embryo state, and is advancing toward
s that constitution andarrangement. By observ
ation, we know somewhat of the economy, actio
n, andnourishment of a finished animal; but w
e must transfer with great cautionthat observ
ation to the growth of a foetus in the womb, 
and still more tothe formation of an animalcu
le in the loins of its male parent. Nature,we
 find, even from our limited experience, poss
esses an infinite numberof springs and princi
ples, which incessantly discover themselves o
n everychange of her position and situation. 
And what new and unknown principleswould actu
ate her in so new and unknown a situation as 
that of theformation of a universe, we cannot
, without the utmost temerity, pretendto dete
rmine.A very small part of this great system,
 during a very short time, is veryimperfectly
 discovered to us; and do we thence pronounce
 decisivelyconcerning the origin of the whole
?Admirable conclusion! Stone, wood, brick, ir
on, brass, have not, at thistime, in this min
ute globe of earth, an order or arrangement w
ithouthuman art and contrivance; therefore th
e universe could not originallyattain its ord
er and arrangement, without something similar
 to human art.But is a part of nature a rule 
for another part very wide of the former?Is i
t a rule for the whole? Is a very small part 
a rule for the universe?Is nature in one situ
ation, a certain rule for nature in anothersi
tuation vastly different from the former?And 
can you blame me, CLEANTHES, if I here imitat
e the prudent reserve ofSIMONIDES, who, accor
ding to the noted story, being asked by HIERO
,What God was? desired a day to think of it, 
and then two days more; andafter that manner 
continually prolonged the term, without ever 
bringingin his definition or description? Cou
ld you even blame me, if I hadanswered at fir
st, that I did not know, and was sensible tha
t thissubject lay vastly beyond the reach of 
my faculties? You might cry outsceptic and ra
iller, as much as you pleased: but having fou
nd, in so manyother subjects much more famili
ar, the imperfections and evencontradictions 
of human reason, I never should expect any su
ccess fromits feeble conjectures, in a subjec
t so sublime, and so remote from thesphere of
 our observation. When two species of objects
 have always beenobserved to be conjoined tog
ether, I can infer, by custom, the existenceo
f one wherever I see the existence of the oth
er; and this I call anargument from experienc
e. But how this argument can have place, wher
e theobjects, as in the present case, are sin
gle, individual, withoutparallel, or specific
 resemblance, may be difficult to explain. An
d willany man tell me with a serious countena
nce, that an orderly universe mustarise from 
some thought and art like the human, because 
we haveexperience of it? To ascertain this re
asoning, it were requisite that wehad experie
nce of the origin of worlds; and it is not su
fficient, surely,that we have seen ships and 
cities arise from human art and contrivance..
.PHILO was proceeding in this vehement manner
, somewhat between jest andearnest, as it app
eared to me, when he observed some signs of i
mpatiencein CLEANTHES, and then immediately s
topped short. What I had to suggest,said CLEA
NTHES, is only that you would not abuse terms
, or make use ofpopular expressions to subver
t philosophical reasonings. You know, thatthe
 vulgar often distinguish reason from experie
nce, even where thequestion relates only to m
atter of fact and existence; though it isfoun
d, where that reason is properly analysed, th
at it is nothing but aspecies of experience. 
To prove by experience the origin of the univ
ersefrom mind, is not more contrary to common
 speech, than to prove themotion of the earth
 from the same principle. And a caviller migh
t raiseall the same objections to the Coperni
can system, which you have urgedagainst my re
asonings. Have you other earths, might he say
, which youhave seen to move? Have...Yes! cri
ed PHILO, interrupting him, we have other ear
ths. Is not the moonanother earth, which we s
ee to turn round its centre? Is not Venusanot
her earth, where we observe the same phenomen
on? Are not therevolutions of the sun also a 
confirmation, from analogy, of the sametheory
? All the planets, are they not earths, which
 revolve about thesun? Are not the satellites
 moons, which move round Jupiter and Saturn,a
nd along with these primary planets round the
 sun? These analogies andresemblances, with o
thers which I have not mentioned, are the sol
e proofsof the COPERNICAN system; and to you 
it belongs to consider, whether youhave any a
nalogies of the same kind to support your the
ory.In reality, CLEANTHES, continued he, the 
modern system of astronomy isnow so much rece
ived by all inquirers, and has become so esse
ntial a parteven of our earliest education, t
hat we are not commonly very scrupulousin exa
mining the reasons upon which it is founded. 
It is now become amatter of mere curiosity to
 study the first writers on that subject, who
had the full force of prejudice to encounter,
 and were obliged to turntheir arguments on e
very side in order to render them popular and
convincing. But if we peruse GALILEO's famous
 Dialogues concerning thesystem of the world,
 we shall find, that that great genius, one o
f thesublimest that ever existed, first bent 
all his endeavours to prove, thatthere was no
 foundation for the distinction commonly made
 betweenelementary and celestial substances. 
The schools, proceeding from theillusions of 
sense, had carried this distinction very far;
 and hadestablished the latter substances to 
be ingenerable, incorruptible,unalterable, im
passable; and had assigned all the opposite q
ualities tothe former. But GALILEO, beginning
 with the moon, proved its similarityin every
 particular to the earth; its convex figure, 
its natural darknesswhen not illuminated, its
 density, its distinction into solid and liqu
id,the variations of its phases, the mutual i
lluminations of the earth andmoon, their mutu
al eclipses, the inequalities of the lunar su
rface, &c.After many instances of this kind, 
with regard to all the planets, menplainly sa
w that these bodies became proper objects of 
experience; andthat the similarity of their n
ature enabled us to extend the samearguments 
and phenomena from one to the other.In this c
autious proceeding of the astronomers, you ma
y read your owncondemnation, CLEANTHES; or ra
ther may see, that the subject in which youar
e engaged exceeds all human reason and inquir
y. Can you pretend to showany such similarity
 between the fabric of a house, and the gener
ation ofa universe? Have you ever seen nature
 in any such situation as resemblesthe first 
arrangement of the elements? Have worlds ever
 been formed underyour eye; and have you had 
leisure to observe the whole progress of thep
henomenon, from the first appearance of order
 to its final consummation?If you have, then 
cite your experience, and deliver your theory
.PART 3How the most absurd argument, replied 
CLEANTHES, in the hands of a man ofingenuity 
and invention, may acquire an air of probabil
ity! Are you notaware, PHILO, that it became 
necessary for Copernicus and his firstdiscipl
es to prove the similarity of the terrestrial
 and celestialmatter; because several philoso
phers, blinded by old systems, andsupported b
y some sensible appearances, had denied this 
similarity? butthat it is by no means necessa
ry, that Theists should prove thesimilarity o
f the works of Nature to those of Art; becaus
e thissimilarity is self-evident and undeniab
le? The same matter, a like form;what more is
 requisite to show an analogy between their c
auses, and toascertain the origin of all thin
gs from a divine purpose and intention?Your o
bjections, I must freely tell you, are no bet
ter than the abstrusecavils of those philosop
hers who denied motion; and ought to be refut
edin the same manner, by illustrations, examp
les, and instances, ratherthan by serious arg
ument and philosophy.Suppose, therefore, that
 an articulate voice were heard in the clouds
,much louder and more melodious than any whic
h human art could ever reach:Suppose, that th
is voice were extended in the same instant ov
er allnations, and spoke to each nation in it
s own language and dialect:Suppose, that the 
words delivered not only contain a just sense
 andmeaning, but convey some instruction alto
gether worthy of a benevolentBeing, superior 
to mankind: Could you possibly hesitate a mom
entconcerning the cause of this voice? and mu
st you not instantly ascribe itto some design
 or purpose? Yet I cannot see but all the sam
e objections(if they merit that appellation) 
which lie against the system of Theism,may al
so be produced against this inference.Might y
ou not say, that all conclusions concerning f
act were founded onexperience: that when we h
ear an articulate voice in the dark, and then
ceinfer a man, it is only the resemblance of 
the effects which leads us toconclude that th
ere is a like resemblance in the cause: but t
hat thisextraordinary voice, by its loudness,
 extent, and flexibility to alllanguages, bea
rs so little analogy to any human voice, that
 we have noreason to suppose any analogy in t
heir causes: and consequently, that arational
, wise, coherent speech proceeded, you know n
ot whence, from someaccidental whistling of t
he winds, not from any divine reason orintell
igence? You see clearly your own objections i
n these cavils, and Ihope too you see clearly
, that they cannot possibly have more force i
nthe one case than in the other.But to bring 
the case still nearer the present one of the 
universe, Ishall make two suppositions, which
 imply not any absurdity orimpossibility. Sup
pose that there is a natural, universal, inva
riablelanguage, common to every individual of
 human race; and that books arenatural produc
tions, which perpetuate themselves in the sam
e manner withanimals and vegetables, by desce
nt and propagation. Several expressionsof our
 passions contain a universal language: all b
rute animals have anatural speech, which, how
ever limited, is very intelligible to their o
wnspecies. And as there are infinitely fewer 
parts and less contrivance inthe finest compo
sition of eloquence, than in the coarsest org
anised body,the propagation of an Iliad or Ae
neid is an easier supposition than thatof any
 plant or animal.Suppose, therefore, that you
 enter into your library, thus peopled bynatu
ral volumes, containing the most refined reas
on and most exquisitebeauty; could you possib
ly open one of them, and doubt, that its orig
inalcause bore the strongest analogy to mind 
and intelligence? When itreasons and discours
es; when it expostulates, argues, and enforce
s itsviews and topics; when it applies someti
mes to the pure intellect,sometimes to the af
fections; when it collects, disposes, and ado
rns everyconsideration suited to the subject;
 could you persist in asserting, thatall this
, at the bottom, had really no meaning; and t
hat the firstformation of this volume in the 
loins of its original parent proceedednot fro
m thought and design? Your obstinacy, I know,
 reaches not thatdegree of firmness: even you
r sceptical play and wantonness would beabash
ed at so glaring an absurdity.But if there be
 any difference, PHILO, between this supposed
 case and thereal one of the universe, it is 
all to the advantage of the latter. Theanatom
y of an animal affords many stronger instance
s of design than theperusal of LIVY or TACITU
S; and any objection which you start in thefo
rmer case, by carrying me back to so unusual 
and extraordinary a sceneas the first formati
on of worlds, the same objection has place on
 thesupposition of our vegetating library. Ch
oose, then, your party, PHILO,without ambigui
ty or evasion; assert either that a rational 
volume is noproof of a rational cause, or adm
it of a similar cause to all the worksof natu
re.Let me here observe too, continued CLEANTH
ES, that this religiousargument, instead of b
eing weakened by that scepticism so much affe
ctedby you, rather acquires force from it, an
d becomes more firm andundisputed. To exclude
 all argument or reasoning of every kind, is 
eitheraffectation or madness. The declared pr
ofession of every reasonablesceptic is only t
o reject abstruse, remote, and refined argume
nts; toadhere to common sense and the plain i
nstincts of nature; and to assent,wherever an
y reasons strike him with so full a force tha
t he cannot,without the greatest violence, pr
event it. Now the arguments for NaturalReligi
on are plainly of this kind; and nothing but 
the most perverse,obstinate metaphysics can r
eject them. Consider, anatomise the eye;surve
y its structure and contrivance; and tell me,
 from your own feeling,if the idea of a contr
iver does not immediately flow in upon you wi
th aforce like that of sensation. The most ob
vious conclusion, surely, is infavour of desi
gn; and it requires time, reflection, and stu
dy, to summonup those frivolous, though abstr
use objections, which can supportInfidelity. 
Who can behold the male and female of each sp
ecies, thecorrespondence of their parts and i
nstincts, their passions, and wholecourse of 
life before and after generation, but must be
 sensible, thatthe propagation of the species
 is intended by Nature? Millions andmillions 
of such instances present themselves through 
every part of theuniverse; and no language ca
n convey a more intelligible irresistiblemean
ing, than the curious adjustment of final cau
ses. To what degree,therefore, of blind dogma
tism must one have attained, to reject suchna
tural and such convincing arguments?Some beau
ties in writing we may meet with, which seem 
contrary to rules,and which gain the affectio
ns, and animate the imagination, in oppositio
nto all the precepts of criticism, and to the
 authority of the establishedmasters of art. 
And if the argument for Theism be, as you pre
tend,contradictory to the principles of logic
; its universal, its irresistibleinfluence pr
oves clearly, that there may be arguments of 
a like irregularnature. Whatever cavils may b
e urged, an orderly world, as well as acohere
nt, articulate speech, will still be received
 as an incontestableproof of design and inten
tion.It sometimes happens, I own, that the re
ligious arguments have not theirdue influence
 on an ignorant savage and barbarian; not bec
ause they areobscure and difficult, but becau
se he never asks himself any questionwith reg
ard to them. Whence arises the curious struct
ure of an animal?From the copulation of its p
arents. And these whence? From their parents?
A few removes set the objects at such a dista
nce, that to him they arelost in darkness and
 confusion; nor is he actuated by any curiosi
ty totrace them further. But this is neither 
dogmatism nor scepticism, butstupidity: a sta
te of mind very different from your sifting, 
inquisitivedisposition, my ingenious friend. 
You can trace causes from effects: Youcan com
pare the most distant and remote objects: and
 your greatest errorsproceed not from barrenn
ess of thought and invention, but from toolux
uriant a fertility, which suppresses your nat
ural good sense, by aprofusion of unnecessary
 scruples and objections.Here I could observe
, HERMIPPUS, that PHILO was a little embarras
sed andconfounded: But while he hesitated in 
delivering an answer, luckily forhim, DEMEA b
roke in upon the discourse, and saved his cou
ntenance.Your instance, CLEANTHES, said he, d
rawn from books and language, beingfamiliar, 
has, I confess, so much more force on that ac
count: but isthere not some danger too in thi
s very circumstance; and may it notrender us 
presumptuous, by making us imagine we compreh
end the Deity, andhave some adequate idea of 
his nature and attributes? When I read avolum
e, I enter into the mind and intention of the
 author: I become him,in a manner, for the in
stant; and have an immediate feeling andconce
ption of those ideas which revolved in his im
agination whileemployed in that composition. 
But so near an approach we never surely canma
ke to the Deity. His ways are not our ways. H
is attributes are perfect,but incomprehensibl
e. And this volume of nature contains a great
 andinexplicable riddle, more than any intell
igible discourse or reasoning.The ancient PLA
TONISTS, you know, were the most religious an
d devout ofall the Pagan philosophers; yet ma
ny of them, particularly PLOTINUS,expressly d
eclare, that intellect or understanding is no
t to be ascribedto the Deity; and that our mo
st perfect worship of him consists, not inact
s of veneration, reverence, gratitude, or lov
e; but in a certainmysterious self-annihilati
on, or total extinction of all our faculties.
These ideas are, perhaps, too far stretched; 
but still it must beacknowledged, that, by re
presenting the Deity as so intelligible andco
mprehensible, and so similar to a human mind,
 we are guilty of thegrossest and most narrow
 partiality, and make ourselves the model of 
thewhole universe.All the sentiments of the h
uman mind, gratitude, resentment, love,friend
ship, approbation, blame, pity, emulation, en
vy, have a plainreference to the state and si
tuation of man, and are calculated forpreserv
ing the existence and promoting the activity 
of such a being insuch circumstances. It seem
s, therefore, unreasonable to transfer suchse
ntiments to a supreme existence, or to suppos
e him actuated by them;and the phenomena besi
des of the universe will not support us in su
ch atheory. All our ideas, derived from the s
enses, are confessedly false andillusive; and
 cannot therefore be supposed to have place i
n a supremeintelligence: And as the ideas of 
internal sentiment, added to those ofthe exte
rnal senses, compose the whole furniture of h
uman understanding,we may conclude, that none
 of the materials of thought are in any respe
ctsimilar in the human and in the divine inte
lligence. Now, as to themanner of thinking; h
ow can we make any comparison between them, o
rsuppose them any wise resembling? Our though
t is fluctuating, uncertain,fleeting, success
ive, and compounded; and were we to remove th
esecircumstances, we absolutely annihilate it
s essence, and it would in sucha case be an a
buse of terms to apply to it the name of thou
ght or reason.At least if it appear more piou
s and respectful (as it really is) stillto re
tain these terms, when we mention the Supreme
 Being, we ought toacknowledge, that their me
aning, in that case, is totallyincomprehensib
le; and that the infirmities of our nature do
 not permit usto reach any ideas which in the
 least correspond to the ineffablesublimity o
f the Divine attributes.PART 4It seems strang
e to me, said CLEANTHES, that you, DEMEA, who
 are sosincere in the cause of religion, shou
ld still maintain the mysterious,incomprehens
ible nature of the Deity, and should insist s
o strenuouslythat he has no manner of likenes
s or resemblance to human creatures. TheDeity
, I can readily allow, possesses many powers 
and attributes of whichwe can have no compreh
ension: But if our ideas, so far as they go, 
be notjust, and adequate, and correspondent t
o his real nature, I know not whatthere is in
 this subject worth insisting on. Is the name
, without anymeaning, of such mighty importan
ce? Or how do you mystics, who maintainthe ab
solute incomprehensibility of the Deity, diff
er from Sceptics orAtheists, who assert, that
 the first cause of all is unknown andunintel
ligible? Their temerity must be very great, i
f, after rejectingthe production by a mind, I
 mean a mind resembling the human, (for I kno
wof no other,) they pretend to assign, with c
ertainty, any other specificintelligible caus
e: And their conscience must be very scrupulo
us indeed,if they refuse to call the universa
l unknown cause a God or Deity; and tobestow 
on him as many sublime eulogies and unmeaning
 epithets as youshall please to require of th
em.Who could imagine, replied DEMEA, that CLE
ANTHES, the calm philosophicalCLEANTHES, woul
d attempt to refute his antagonists by affixi
ng a nicknameto them; and, like the common bi
gots and inquisitors of the age, haverecourse
 to invective and declamation, instead of rea
soning? Or does henot perceive, that these to
pics are easily retorted, and thatAnthropomor
phite is an appellation as invidious, and imp
lies as dangerousconsequences, as the epithet
 of Mystic, with which he has honoured us? In
reality, CLEANTHES, consider what it is you a
ssert when you represent theDeity as similar 
to a human mind and understanding. What is th
e soul ofman? A composition of various facult
ies, passions, sentiments, ideas;united, inde
ed, into one self or person, but still distin
ct from eachother. When it reasons, the ideas
, which are the parts of its discourse,arrang
e themselves in a certain form or order; whic
h is not preservedentire for a moment, but im
mediately gives place to another arrangement.
New opinions, new passions, new affections, n
ew feelings arise, whichcontinually diversify
 the mental scene, and produce in it the grea
testvariety and most rapid succession imagina
ble. How is this compatible withthat perfect 
immutability and simplicity which all true Th
eists ascribeto the Deity? By the same act, s
ay they, he sees past, present, andfuture: Hi
s love and hatred, his mercy and justice, are
 one individualoperation: He is entire in eve
ry point of space; and complete in everyinsta
nt of duration. No succession, no change, no 
acquisition, nodiminution. What he is implies
 not in it any shadow of distinction ordivers
ity. And what he is this moment he ever has b
een, and ever will be,without any new judgeme
nt, sentiment, or operation. He stands fixed 
inone simple, perfect state: nor can you ever
 say, with any propriety, thatthis act of his
 is different from that other; or that this j
udgement oridea has been lately formed, and w
ill give place, by succession, to anydifferen
t judgement or idea.I can readily allow, said
 CLEANTHES, that those who maintain the perfe
ctsimplicity of the Supreme Being, to the ext
ent in which you haveexplained it, are comple
te Mystics, and chargeable with all theconseq
uences which I have drawn from their opinion.
 They are, in a word,Atheists, without knowin
g it. For though it be allowed, that the Deit
ypossesses attributes of which we have no com
prehension, yet ought wenever to ascribe to h
im any attributes which are absolutely incomp
atiblewith that intelligent nature essential 
to him. A mind, whose acts andsentiments and 
ideas are not distinct and successive; one, t
hat is whollysimple, and totally immutable, i
s a mind which has no thought, no reason,no w
ill, no sentiment, no love, no hatred; or, in
 a word, is no mind atall. It is an abuse of 
terms to give it that appellation; and we may
 aswell speak of limited extension without fi
gure, or of number withoutcomposition.Pray co
nsider, said PHILO, whom you are at present i
nveighing against.You are honouring with the 
appellation of Atheist all the sound, orthodo
xdivines, almost, who have treated of this su
bject; and you will at lastbe, yourself, foun
d, according to your reckoning, the only soun
d Theistin the world. But if idolaters be Ath
eists, as, I think, may justly beasserted, an
d Christian Theologians the same, what become
s of theargument, so much celebrated, derived
 from the universal consent ofmankind?But bec
ause I know you are not much swayed by names 
and authorities, Ishall endeavour to show you
, a little more distinctly, the inconvenience
sof that Anthropomorphism, which you have emb
raced; and shall prove, thatthere is no groun
d to suppose a plan of the world to be formed
 in theDivine mind, consisting of distinct id
eas, differently arranged, in thesame manner 
as an architect forms in his head the plan of
 a house whichhe intends to execute.It is not
 easy, I own, to see what is gained by this s
upposition, whetherwe judge of the matter by 
Reason or by Experience. We are still obliged
to mount higher, in order to find the cause o
f this cause, which you hadassigned as satisf
actory and conclusive.If Reason (I mean abstr
act reason, derived from inquiries a priori) 
benot alike mute with regard to all questions
 concerning cause and effect,this sentence at
 least it will venture to pronounce, That a m
ental world,or universe of ideas, requires a 
cause as much, as does a material world,or un
iverse of objects; and, if similar in its arr
angement, must requirea similar cause. For wh
at is there in this subject, which should occ
asiona different conclusion or inference? In 
an abstract view, they areentirely alike; and
 no difficulty attends the one supposition, w
hich isnot common to both of them.Again, when
 we will needs force Experience to pronounce 
some sentence,even on these subjects which li
e beyond her sphere, neither can sheperceive 
any material difference in this particular, b
etween these twokinds of worlds; but finds th
em to be governed by similar principles, andt
o depend upon an equal variety of causes in t
heir operations. We havespecimens in miniatur
e of both of them. Our own mind resembles the
 one; avegetable or animal body the other. Le
t experience, therefore, judge fromthese samp
les. Nothing seems more delicate, with regard
 to its causes,than thought; and as these cau
ses never operate in two persons after thesam
e manner, so we never find two persons who th
ink exactly alike. Norindeed does the same pe
rson think exactly alike at any two different
periods of time. A difference of age, of the 
disposition of his body, ofweather, of food, 
of company, of books, of passions; any of the
separticulars, or others more minute, are suf
ficient to alter the curiousmachinery of thou
ght, and communicate to it very different mov
ements andoperations. As far as we can judge,
 vegetables and animal bodies are notmore del
icate in their motions, nor depend upon a gre
ater variety or morecurious adjustment of spr
ings and principles.How, therefore, shall we 
satisfy ourselves concerning the cause of tha
tBeing whom you suppose the Author of Nature,
 or, according to your systemof Anthropomorph
ism, the ideal world, into which you trace th
e material?Have we not the same reason to tra
ce that ideal world into another idealworld, 
or new intelligent principle? But if we stop,
 and go no further;why go so far? why not sto
p at the material world? How can we satisfyou
rselves without going on in infinitum? And, a
fter all, whatsatisfaction is there in that i
nfinite progression? Let us remember thestory
 of the Indian philosopher and his elephant. 
It was never moreapplicable than to the prese
nt subject. If the material world rests upona
 similar ideal world, this ideal world must r
est upon some other; and soon, without end. I
t were better, therefore, never to look beyon
d thepresent material world. By supposing it 
to contain the principle of itsorder within i
tself, we really assert it to be God; and the
 sooner wearrive at that Divine Being, so muc
h the better. When you go one stepbeyond the 
mundane system, you only excite an inquisitiv
e humour which itis impossible ever to satisf
y.To say, that the different ideas which comp
ose the reason of the SupremeBeing, fall into
 order of themselves, and by their own nature
, is reallyto talk without any precise meanin
g. If it has a meaning, I would fainknow, why
 it is not as good sense to say, that the par
ts of the materialworld fall into order of th
emselves and by their own nature. Can the one
opinion be intelligible, while the other is n
ot so?We have, indeed, experience of ideas wh
ich fall into order of themselves,and without
 any known cause. But, I am sure, we have a m
uch largerexperience of matter which does the
 same; as, in all instances ofgeneration and 
vegetation, where the accurate analysis of th
e causeexceeds all human comprehension. We ha
ve also experience of particularsystems of th
ought and of matter which have no order; of t
he first inmadness, of the second in corrupti
on. Why, then, should we think, thatorder is 
more essential to one than the other? And if 
it requires a causein both, what do we gain b
y your system, in tracing the universe ofobje
cts into a similar universe of ideas? The fir
st step which we makeleads us on for ever. It
 were, therefore, wise in us to limit all our
inquiries to the present world, without looki
ng further. No satisfactioncan ever be attain
ed by these speculations, which so far exceed
 thenarrow bounds of human understanding.It w
as usual with the PERIPATETICS, you know, CLE
ANTHES, when the causeof any phenomenon was d
emanded, to have recourse to their faculties 
oroccult qualities; and to say, for instance,
 that bread nourished by itsnutritive faculty
, and senna purged by its purgative. But it h
as beendiscovered, that this subterfuge was n
othing but the disguise ofignorance; and that
 these philosophers, though less ingenuous, r
eallysaid the same thing with the sceptics or
 the vulgar, who fairly confessedthat they kn
ew not the cause of these phenomena. In like 
manner, when itis asked, what cause produces 
order in the ideas of the Supreme Being;can a
ny other reason be assigned by you, Anthropom
orphites, than that itis a rational faculty, 
and that such is the nature of the Deity? But
 whya similar answer will not be equally sati
sfactory in accounting for theorder of the wo
rld, without having recourse to any such inte
lligentcreator as you insist on, may be diffi
cult to determine. It is only tosay, that suc
h is the nature of material objects, and that
 they are alloriginally possessed of a facult
y of order and proportion. These are onlymore
 learned and elaborate ways of confessing our
 ignorance; nor has theone hypothesis any rea
l advantage above the other, except in its gr
eaterconformity to vulgar prejudices.You have
 displayed this argument with great emphasis,
 replied CLEANTHES:You seem not sensible how 
easy it is to answer it. Even in common life,
if I assign a cause for any event, is it any 
objection, PHILO, that Icannot assign the cau
se of that cause, and answer every new questi
onwhich may incessantly be started? And what 
philosophers could possiblysubmit to so rigid
 a rule? philosophers, who confess ultimate c
auses tobe totally unknown; and are sensible,
 that the most refined principlesinto which t
hey trace the phenomena, are still to them as
 inexplicable asthese phenomena themselves ar
e to the vulgar. The order and arrangementof 
nature, the curious adjustment of final cause
s, the plain use andintention of every part a
nd organ; all these bespeak in the clearestla
nguage an intelligent cause or author. The he
avens and the earth joinin the same testimony
: The whole chorus of Nature raises one hymn 
to thepraises of its Creator. You alone, or a
lmost alone, disturb this generalharmony. You
 start abstruse doubts, cavils, and objection
s: You ask me,what is the cause of this cause
? I know not; I care not; that concernsnot me
. I have found a Deity; and here I stop my in
quiry. Let those gofurther, who are wiser or 
more enterprising.I pretend to be neither, re
plied PHILO: And for that very reason, Ishoul
d never perhaps have attempted to go so far; 
especially when I amsensible, that I must at 
last be contented to sit down with the samean
swer, which, without further trouble, might h
ave satisfied me from thebeginning. If I am s
till to remain in utter ignorance of causes, 
and canabsolutely give an explication of noth
ing, I shall never esteem it anyadvantage to 
shove off for a moment a difficulty, which, y
ou acknowledge,must immediately, in its full 
force, recur upon me. Naturalists indeedvery 
justly explain particular effects by more gen
eral causes, thoughthese general causes thems
elves should remain in the end totallyinexpli
cable; but they never surely thought it satis
factory to explain aparticular effect by a pa
rticular cause, which was no more to beaccoun
ted for than the effect itself. An ideal syst
em, arranged ofitself, without a precedent de
sign, is not a whit more explicable than amat
erial one, which attains its order in a like 
manner; nor is there anymore difficulty in th
e latter supposition than in the former.PART 
5But to show you still more inconveniences, c
ontinued PHILO, in yourAnthropomorphism, plea
se to take a new survey of your principles. L
ikeeffects prove like causes. This is the exp
erimental argument; and this,you say too, is 
the sole theological argument. Now, it is cer
tain, thatthe liker the effects are which are
 seen, and the liker the causes whichare infe
rred, the stronger is the argument. Every dep
arture on eitherside diminishes the probabili
ty, and renders the experiment lessconclusive
. You cannot doubt of the principle; neither 
ought you toreject its consequences.All the n
ew discoveries in astronomy, which prove the 
immense grandeurand magnificence of the works
 of Nature, are so many additional argumentsf
or a Deity, according to the true system of T
heism; but, according toyour hypothesis of ex
perimental Theism, they become so many object
ions,by removing the effect still further fro
m all resemblance to the effectsof human art 
and contrivance. For, if LUCRETIUS[Lib. II. 1
094], evenfollowing the old system of the wor
ld, could exclaim,    Quis regere immensi sum
mam, quis habere profundi    Indu manu valida
s potis est moderanter habenas?    Quis parit
er coelos omnes convertere? et omnes    Ignib
us aetheriis terras suffire feraces?    Omnib
us inque locis esse omni tempore praesto?If T
ULLY [De. nat. Deor. Lib. I] esteemed this re
asoning so natural,as to put it into the mout
h of his EPICUREAN:"Quibus enim oculis animi 
intueri potuit vester Plato fabricam illamtan
ti operis, qua construi a Deo atque aedificar
i mundum facit? quaemolitio? quae ferramenta?
 qui vectes? quae machinae? qui ministri tant
imuneris fuerunt? quemadmodum autem obedire e
t parere voluntati architectiaer, ignis, aqua
, terra potuerunt?"If this argument, I say, h
ad any force in former ages, how much greater
must it have at present, when the bounds of N
ature are so infinitelyenlarged, and such a m
agnificent scene is opened to us? It is still
 moreunreasonable to form our idea of so unli
mited a cause from our experienceof the narro
w productions of human design and invention.T
he discoveries by microscopes, as they open a
 new universe in miniature,are still objectio
ns, according to you, arguments, according to
 me. Thefurther we push our researches of thi
s kind, we are still led to inferthe universa
l cause of all to be vastly different from ma
nkind, or fromany object of human experience 
and observation.And what say you to the disco
veries in anatomy, chemistry, botany?...These
 surely are no objections, replied CLEANTHES;
 they only discover newinstances of art and c
ontrivance. It is still the image of mind ref
lectedon us from innumerable objects. Add, a 
mind like the human, said PHILO. Iknow of no 
other, replied CLEANTHES. And the liker the b
etter, insistedPHILO. To be sure, said CLEANT
HES.Now, CLEANTHES, said PHILO, with an air o
f alacrity and triumph, mark theconsequences.
 First, By this method of reasoning, you reno
unce all claimto infinity in any of the attri
butes of the Deity. For, as the causeought on
ly to be proportioned to the effect, and the 
effect, so far as itfalls under our cognisanc
e, is not infinite; what pretensions have we,
upon your suppositions, to ascribe that attri
bute to the Divine Being?You will still insis
t, that, by removing him so much from all sim
ilarityto human creatures, we give in to the 
most arbitrary hypothesis, and atthe same tim
e weaken all proofs of his existence.Secondly
, You have no reason, on your theory, for asc
ribing perfection tothe Deity, even in his fi
nite capacity, or for supposing him free from
every error, mistake, or incoherence, in his 
undertakings. There are manyinexplicable diff
iculties in the works of Nature, which, if we
 allow aperfect author to be proved a priori,
 are easily solved, and become onlyseeming di
fficulties, from the narrow capacity of man, 
who cannot traceinfinite relations. But accor
ding to your method of reasoning, thesediffic
ulties become all real; and perhaps will be i
nsisted on, as newinstances of likeness to hu
man art and contrivance. At least, you mustac
knowledge, that it is impossible for us to te
ll, from our limitedviews, whether this syste
m contains any great faults, or deserves anyc
onsiderable praise, if compared to other poss
ible, and even realsystems. Could a peasant, 
if the Aeneid were read to him, pronounce tha
tpoem to be absolutely faultless, or even ass
ign to it its proper rankamong the production
s of human wit, he, who had never seen any ot
herproduction?But were this world ever so per
fect a production, it must still remainuncert
ain, whether all the excellences of the work 
can justly be ascribedto the workman. If we s
urvey a ship, what an exalted idea must we fo
rm ofthe ingenuity of the carpenter who frame
d so complicated, useful, andbeautiful a mach
ine? And what surprise must we feel, when we 
find him astupid mechanic, who imitated other
s, and copied an art, which, through along su
ccession of ages, after multiplied trials, mi
stakes, corrections,deliberations, and contro
versies, had been gradually improving? Manywo
rlds might have been botched and bungled, thr
oughout an eternity, erethis system was struc
k out; much labour lost, many fruitless trial
s made;and a slow, but continued improvement 
carried on during infinite ages inthe art of 
world-making. In such subjects, who can deter
mine, where thetruth; nay, who can conjecture
 where the probability lies, amidst a greatnu
mber of hypotheses which may be proposed, and
 a still greater which maybe imagined?And wha
t shadow of an argument, continued PHILO, can
 you produce, fromyour hypothesis, to prove t
he unity of the Deity? A great number of menj
oin in building a house or ship, in rearing a
 city, in framing acommonwealth; why may not 
several deities combine in contriving andfram
ing a world? This is only so much greater sim
ilarity to humanaffairs. By sharing the work 
among several, we may so much further limitth
e attributes of each, and get rid of that ext
ensive power andknowledge, which must be supp
osed in one deity, and which, according toyou
, can only serve to weaken the proof of his e
xistence. And if suchfoolish, such vicious cr
eatures as man, can yet often unite in framin
gand executing one plan, how much more those 
deities or demons, whom wemay suppose several
 degrees more perfect!To multiply causes with
out necessity, is indeed contrary to truephil
osophy: but this principle applies not to the
 present case. Were onedeity antecedently pro
ved by your theory, who were possessed of eve
ryattribute requisite to the production of th
e universe; it would beneedless, I own, (thou
gh not absurd,) to suppose any other deityexi
stent. But while it is still a question, Whet
her all these attributesare united in one sub
ject, or dispersed among several independent 
beings,by what phenomena in nature can we pre
tend to decide the controversy?Where we see a
 body raised in a scale, we are sure that the
re is in theopposite scale, however concealed
 from sight, some counterpoising weightequal 
to it; but it is still allowed to doubt, whet
her that weight be anaggregate of several dis
tinct bodies, or one uniform united mass. And
 ifthe weight requisite very much exceeds any
 thing which we have ever seenconjoined in an
y single body, the former supposition becomes
 still moreprobable and natural. An intellige
nt being of such vast power andcapacity as is
 necessary to produce the universe, or, to sp
eak in thelanguage of ancient philosophy, so 
prodigious an animal exceeds allanalogy, and 
even comprehension.But further, CLEANTHES: me
n are mortal, and renew their species bygener
ation; and this is common to all living creat
ures. The two greatsexes of male and female, 
says MILTON, animate the world. Why must this
circumstance, so universal, so essential, be 
excluded from those numerousand limited deiti
es? Behold, then, the theogony of ancient tim
es broughtback upon us.And why not become a p
erfect Anthropomorphite? Why not assert the d
eityor deities to be corporeal, and to have e
yes, a nose, mouth, ears, &c.?EPICURUS mainta
ined, that no man had ever seen reason but in
 a humanfigure; therefore the gods must have 
a human figure. And this argument,which is de
servedly so much ridiculed by CICERO, becomes
, according toyou, solid and philosophical.In
 a word, CLEANTHES, a man who follows your hy
pothesis is able perhapsto assert, or conject
ure, that the universe, sometime, arose froms
omething like design: but beyond that positio
n he cannot ascertain onesingle circumstance;
 and is left afterwards to fix every point of
 histheology by the utmost license of fancy a
nd hypothesis. This world, foraught he knows,
 is very faulty and imperfect, compared to a 
superiorstandard; and was only the first rude
 essay of some infant deity, whoafterwards ab
andoned it, ashamed of his lame performance: 
it is the workonly of some dependent, inferio
r deity; and is the object of derision tohis 
superiors: it is the production of old age an
d dotage in somesuperannuated deity; and ever
 since his death, has run on at adventures,fr
om the first impulse and active force which i
t received from him. Youjustly give signs of 
horror, DEMEA, at these strange suppositions;
 butthese, and a thousand more of the same ki
nd, are CLEANTHES'ssuppositions, not mine. Fr
om the moment the attributes of the Deity are
supposed finite, all these have place. And I 
cannot, for my part, thinkthat so wild and un
settled a system of theology is, in any respe
ct,preferable to none at all.These suppositio
ns I absolutely disown, cried CLEANTHES: they
 strike me,however, with no horror, especiall
y when proposed in that rambling way inwhich 
they drop from you. On the contrary, they giv
e me pleasure, when Isee, that, by the utmost
 indulgence of your imagination, you never ge
trid of the hypothesis of design in the unive
rse, but are obliged at everyturn to have rec
ourse to it. To this concession I adhere stea
dily; andthis I regard as a sufficient founda
tion for religion.PART 6It must be a slight f
abric, indeed, said DEMEA, which can be erect
ed onso tottering a foundation. While we are 
uncertain whether there is onedeity or many; 
whether the deity or deities, to whom we owe 
ourexistence, be perfect or imperfect, subord
inate or supreme, dead oralive, what trust or
 confidence can we repose in them? What devot
ion orworship address to them? What veneratio
n or obedience pay them? To allthe purposes o
f life the theory of religion becomes altoget
her useless:and even with regard to speculati
ve consequences, its uncertainty,according to
 you, must render it totally precarious and u
nsatisfactory.To render it still more unsatis
factory, said PHILO, there occurs to meanothe
r hypothesis, which must acquire an air of pr
obability from themethod of reasoning so much
 insisted on by CLEANTHES. That like effectsa
rise from like causes: this principle he supp
oses the foundation of allreligion. But there
 is another principle of the same kind, no le
sscertain, and derived from the same source o
f experience; that whereseveral known circums
tances are observed to be similar, the unknow
n willalso be found similar. Thus, if we see 
the limbs of a human body, weconclude that it
 is also attended with a human head, though h
id from us.Thus, if we see, through a chink i
n a wall, a small part of the sun, weconclude
, that, were the wall removed, we should see 
the whole body. Inshort, this method of reaso
ning is so obvious and familiar, that noscrup
le can ever be made with regard to its solidi
ty.Now, if we survey the universe, so far as 
it falls under our knowledge,it bears a great
 resemblance to an animal or organised body, 
and seemsactuated with a like principle of li
fe and motion. A continualcirculation of matt
er in it produces no disorder: a continual wa
ste inevery part is incessantly repaired: the
 closest sympathy is perceivedthroughout the 
entire system: and each part or member, in pe
rforming itsproper offices, operates both to 
its own preservation and to that of thewhole.
 The world, therefore, I infer, is an animal;
 and the Deity is theSOUL of the world, actua
ting it, and actuated by it.You have too much
 learning, CLEANTHES, to be at all surprised 
at thisopinion, which, you know, was maintain
ed by almost all the Theists ofantiquity, and
 chiefly prevails in their discourses and rea
sonings. Forthough, sometimes, the ancient ph
ilosophers reason from final causes, asif the
y thought the world the workmanship of God; y
et it appears rathertheir favourite notion to
 consider it as his body, whose organisationr
enders it subservient to him. And it must be 
confessed, that, as theuniverse resembles mor
e a human body than it does the works of huma
n artand contrivance, if our limited analogy 
could ever, with any propriety,be extended to
 the whole of nature, the inference seems jus
ter in favourof the ancient than the modern t
heory.There are many other advantages, too, i
n the former theory, whichrecommended it to t
he ancient theologians. Nothing more repugnan
t to alltheir notions, because nothing more r
epugnant to common experience, thanmind witho
ut body; a mere spiritual substance, which fe
ll not under theirsenses nor comprehension, a
nd of which they had not observed one singlei
nstance throughout all nature. Mind and body 
they knew, because theyfelt both: an order, a
rrangement, organisation, or internal machine
ry, inboth, they likewise knew, after the sam
e manner: and it could not butseem reasonable
 to transfer this experience to the universe;
 and tosuppose the divine mind and body to be
 also coeval, and to have, both ofthem, order
 and arrangement naturally inherent in them, 
and inseparablefrom them.Here, therefore, is 
a new species of Anthropomorphism, CLEANTHES,
 onwhich you may deliberate; and a theory whi
ch seems not liable to anyconsiderable diffic
ulties. You are too much superior, surely, to
systematical prejudices, to find any more dif
ficulty in supposing ananimal body to be, ori
ginally, of itself, or from unknown causes,po
ssessed of order and organisation, than in su
pposing a similar order tobelong to mind. But
 the vulgar prejudice, that body and mind oug
ht alwaysto accompany each other, ought not, 
one should think, to be entirelyneglected; si
nce it is founded on vulgar experience, the o
nly guide whichyou profess to follow in all t
hese theological inquiries. And if youassert,
 that our limited experience is an unequal st
andard, by which tojudge of the unlimited ext
ent of nature; you entirely abandon your ownh
ypothesis, and must thenceforward adopt our M
ysticism, as you call it,and admit of the abs
olute incomprehensibility of the Divine Natur
e.This theory, I own, replied CLEANTHES, has 
never before occurred to me,though a pretty n
atural one; and I cannot readily, upon so sho
rt anexamination and reflection, deliver any 
opinion with regard to it. Youare very scrupu
lous, indeed, said PHILO: were I to examine a
ny system ofyours, I should not have acted wi
th half that caution and reserve, instarting 
objections and difficulties to it. However, i
f any thing occurto you, you will oblige us b
y proposing it.Why then, replied CLEANTHES, i
t seems to me, that, though the world does,in
 many circumstances, resemble an animal body;
 yet is the analogy alsodefective in many cir
cumstances the most material: no organs of se
nse; noseat of thought or reason; no one prec
ise origin of motion and action. Inshort, it 
seems to bear a stronger resemblance to a veg
etable than to ananimal, and your inference w
ould be so far inconclusive in favour of thes
oul of the world.But, in the next place, your
 theory seems to imply the eternity of thewor
ld; and that is a principle, which, I think, 
can be refuted by thestrongest reasons and pr
obabilities. I shall suggest an argument to t
hispurpose, which, I believe, has not been in
sisted on by any writer. Those,who reason fro
m the late origin of arts and sciences, thoug
h theirinference wants not force, may perhaps
 be refuted by considerationsderived from the
 nature of human society, which is in continu
alrevolution, between ignorance and knowledge
, liberty and slavery, richesand poverty; so 
that it is impossible for us, from our limite
dexperience, to foretell with assurance what 
events may or may not beexpected. Ancient lea
rning and history seem to have been in great 
dangerof entirely perishing after the inundat
ion of the barbarous nations; andhad these co
nvulsions continued a little longer, or been 
a little moreviolent, we should not probably 
have now known what passed in the world afew 
centuries before us. Nay, were it not for the
 superstition of thePopes, who preserved a li
ttle jargon of Latin, in order to support the
appearance of an ancient and universal church
, that tongue must have beenutterly lost; in 
which case, the Western world, being totally 
barbarous,would not have been in a fit dispos
ition for receiving the GREEK languageand lea
rning, which was conveyed to them after the s
acking ofCONSTANTINOPLE. When learning and bo
oks had been extinguished, even themechanical
 arts would have fallen considerably to decay
; and it is easilyimagined, that fable or tra
dition might ascribe to them a much laterorig
in than the true one. This vulgar argument, t
herefore, against theeternity of the world, s
eems a little precarious.But here appears to 
be the foundation of a better argument. LUCUL
LUS wasthe first that brought cherry-trees fr
om ASIA to EUROPE; though that treethrives so
 well in many EUROPEAN climates, that it grow
s in the woodswithout any culture. Is it poss
ible, that throughout a whole eternity, noEUR
OPEAN had ever passed into ASIA, and thought 
of transplanting sodelicious a fruit into his
 own country? Or if the tree was oncetranspla
nted and propagated, how could it ever afterw
ards perish? Empiresmay rise and fall, libert
y and slavery succeed alternately, ignorance 
andknowledge give place to each other; but th
e cherry-tree will still remainin the woods o
f GREECE, SPAIN, and ITALY, and will never be
 affected bythe revolutions of human society.
It is not two thousand years since vines were
 transplanted into FRANCE,though there is no 
climate in the world more favourable to them.
 It isnot three centuries since horses, cows,
 sheep, swine, dogs, corn, wereknown in AMERI
CA. Is it possible, that during the revolutio
ns of a wholeeternity, there never arose a CO
LUMBUS, who might open the communicationbetwe
en EUROPE and that continent? We may as well 
imagine, that all menwould wear stockings for
 ten thousand years, and never have the sense
 tothink of garters to tie them. All these se
em convincing proofs of theyouth, or rather i
nfancy, of the world; as being founded on the
 operationof principles more constant and ste
ady than those by which human societyis gover
ned and directed. Nothing less than a total c
onvulsion of theelements will ever destroy al
l the EUROPEAN animals and vegetables whichar
e now to be found in the Western world.And wh
at argument have you against such convulsions
? replied PHILO.Strong and almost incontestab
le proofs may be traced over the wholeearth, 
that every part of this globe has continued f
or many ages entirelycovered with water. And 
though order were supposed inseparable fromma
tter, and inherent in it; yet may matter be s
usceptible of many andgreat revolutions, thro
ugh the endless periods of eternal duration. 
Theincessant changes, to which every part of 
it is subject, seem to intimatesome such gene
ral transformations; though, at the same time
, it isobservable, that all the changes and c
orruptions of which we have everhad experienc
e, are but passages from one state of order t
o another; norcan matter ever rest in total d
eformity and confusion. What we see in thepar
ts, we may infer in the whole; at least, that
 is the method ofreasoning on which you rest 
your whole theory. And were I obliged todefen
d any particular system of this nature, which
 I never willinglyshould do, I esteem none mo
re plausible than that which ascribes anetern
al inherent principle of order to the world, 
though attended withgreat and continual revol
utions and alterations. This at once solves a
lldifficulties; and if the solution, by being
 so general, is not entirelycomplete and sati
sfactory, it is at least a theory that we mus
t sooner orlater have recourse to, whatever s
ystem we embrace. How could things havebeen a
s they are, were there not an original inhere
nt principle of ordersomewhere, in thought or
 in matter? And it is very indifferent to whi
chof these we give the preference. Chance has
 no place, on any hypothesis,sceptical or rel
igious. Every thing is surely governed by ste
ady,inviolable laws. And were the inmost esse
nce of things laid open to us,we should then 
discover a scene, of which, at present, we ca
n have noidea. Instead of admiring the order 
of natural beings, we should clearlysee that 
it was absolutely impossible for them, in the
 smallest article,ever to admit of any other 
disposition.Were any one inclined to revive t
he ancient Pagan Theology, whichmaintained, a
s we learn from HESIOD, that this globe was g
overned by30,000 deities, who arose from the 
unknown powers of nature: you wouldnaturally 
object, CLEANTHES, that nothing is gained by 
this hypothesis;and that it is as easy to sup
pose all men animals, beings more numerous,bu
t less perfect, to have sprung immediately fr
om a like origin. Push thesame inference a st
ep further, and you will find a numerous soci
ety ofdeities as explicable as one universal 
deity, who possesses withinhimself the powers
 and perfections of the whole society. All th
esesystems, then, of Scepticism, Polytheism, 
and Theism, you must allow, onyour principles
, to be on a like footing, and that no one of
 them has anyadvantage over the others. You m
ay thence learn the fallacy of yourprinciples
.PART 7But here, continued PHILO, in examinin
g the ancient system of the soul ofthe world,
 there strikes me, all on a sudden, a new ide
a, which, if just,must go near to subvert all
 your reasoning, and destroy even your firsti
nferences, on which you repose such confidenc
e. If the universe bears agreater likeness to
 animal bodies and to vegetables, than to the
 works ofhuman art, it is more probable that 
its cause resembles the cause of theformer th
an that of the latter, and its origin ought r
ather to beascribed to generation or vegetati
on, than to reason or design. Yourconclusion,
 even according to your own principles, is th
erefore lame anddefective.Pray open up this a
rgument a little further, said DEMEA, for I d
o notrightly apprehend it in that concise man
ner in which you have expressedit.Our friend 
CLEANTHES, replied PHILO, as you have heard, 
asserts, thatsince no question of fact can be
 proved otherwise than by experience, theexis
tence of a Deity admits not of proof from any
 other medium. Theworld, says he, resembles t
he works of human contrivance; therefore itsc
ause must also resemble that of the other. He
re we may remark, that theoperation of one ve
ry small part of nature, to wit man, upon ano
ther verysmall part, to wit that inanimate ma
tter lying within his reach, is therule by wh
ich CLEANTHES judges of the origin of the who
le; and hemeasures objects, so widely disprop
ortioned, by the same individualstandard. But
 to waive all objections drawn from this topi
c, I affirm,that there are other parts of the
 universe (besides the machines of humaninven
tion) which bear still a greater resemblance 
to the fabric of theworld, and which, therefo
re, afford a better conjecture concerning the
universal origin of this system. These parts 
are animals and vegetables.The world plainly 
resembles more an animal or a vegetable, than
 it does awatch or a knitting-loom. Its cause
, therefore, it is more probable,resembles th
e cause of the former. The cause of the forme
r is generationor vegetation. The cause, ther
efore, of the world, we may infer to besometh
ing similar or analogous to generation or veg
etation.But how is it conceivable, said DEMEA
, that the world can arise from anything simi
lar to vegetation or generation?Very easily, 
replied PHILO. In like manner as a tree sheds
 its seed intothe neighbouring fields, and pr
oduces other trees; so the greatvegetable, th
e world, or this planetary system, produces w
ithin itselfcertain seeds, which, being scatt
ered into the surrounding chaos,vegetate into
 new worlds. A comet, for instance, is the se
ed of a world;and after it has been fully rip
ened, by passing from sun to sun, and starto 
star, it is at last tossed into the unformed 
elements which everywhere surround this unive
rse, and immediately sprouts up into a newsys
tem.Or if, for the sake of variety (for I see
 no other advantage), we shouldsuppose this w
orld to be an animal; a comet is the egg of t
his animal:and in like manner as an ostrich l
ays its egg in the sand, which, withoutany fu
rther care, hatches the egg, and produces a n
ew animal; so...I understand you, says DEMEA:
 But what wild, arbitrary suppositions arethe
se! What data have you for such extraordinary
 conclusions? And is theslight, imaginary res
emblance of the world to a vegetable or an an
imalsufficient to establish the same inferenc
e with regard to both? Objects,which are in g
eneral so widely different, ought they to be 
a standard foreach other?Right, cries PHILO: 
This is the topic on which I have all along i
nsisted.I have still asserted, that we have n
o data to establish any system ofcosmogony. O
ur experience, so imperfect in itself, and so
 limited both inextent and duration, can affo
rd us no probable conjecture concerning thewh
ole of things. But if we must needs fix on so
me hypothesis; by whatrule, pray, ought we to
 determine our choice? Is there any other rul
ethan the greater similarity of the objects c
ompared? And does not a plantor an animal, wh
ich springs from vegetation or generation, be
ar astronger resemblance to the world, than d
oes any artificial machine,which arises from 
reason and design?But what is this vegetation
 and generation of which you talk? said DEMEA
.Can you explain their operations, and anatom
ise that fine internalstructure on which they
 depend?As much, at least, replied PHILO, as 
CLEANTHES can explain the operationsof reason
, or anatomise that internal structure on whi
ch it depends. Butwithout any such elaborate 
disquisitions, when I see an animal, I infer,
that it sprang from generation; and that with
 as great certainty as youconclude a house to
 have been reared by design. These words, gen
eration,reason, mark only certain powers and 
energies in nature, whose effectsare known, b
ut whose essence is incomprehensible; and one
 of theseprinciples, more than the other, has
 no privilege for being made astandard to the
 whole of nature.In reality, DEMEA, it may re
asonably be expected, that the larger theview
s are which we take of things, the better wil
l they conduct us in ourconclusions concernin
g such extraordinary and such magnificent sub
jects.In this little corner of the world alon
e, there are four principles,reason, instinct
, generation, vegetation, which are similar t
o eachother, and are the causes of similar ef
fects. What a number of otherprinciples may w
e naturally suppose in the immense extent and
 variety ofthe universe, could we travel from
 planet to planet, and from system tosystem, 
in order to examine each part of this mighty 
fabric? Any one ofthese four principles above
 mentioned, (and a hundred others which lieop
en to our conjecture,) may afford us a theory
 by which to judge of theorigin of the world;
 and it is a palpable and egregious partialit
y toconfine our view entirely to that princip
le by which our own mindsoperate. Were this p
rinciple more intelligible on that account, s
uch apartiality might be somewhat excusable: 
But reason, in its internalfabric and structu
re, is really as little known to us as instin
ct orvegetation; and, perhaps, even that vagu
e, indeterminate word, Nature, towhich the vu
lgar refer every thing, is not at the bottom 
moreinexplicable. The effects of these princi
ples are all known to us fromexperience; but 
the principles themselves, and their manner o
f operation,are totally unknown; nor is it le
ss intelligible, or less conformable toexperi
ence, to say, that the world arose by vegetat
ion, from a seed shedby another world, than t
o say that it arose from a divine reason orco
ntrivance, according to the sense in which CL
EANTHES understands it.But methinks, said DEM
EA, if the world had a vegetative quality, an
dcould sow the seeds of new worlds into the i
nfinite chaos, this powerwould be still an ad
ditional argument for design in its author. F
orwhence could arise so wonderful a faculty b
ut from design? Or how canorder spring from a
ny thing which perceives not that order which
 itbestows?You need only look around you, rep
lied PHILO, to satisfy yourself withregard to
 this question. A tree bestows order and orga
nisation on thattree which springs from it, w
ithout knowing the order; an animal in thesam
e manner on its offspring; a bird on its nest
; and instances of thiskind are even more fre
quent in the world than those of order, which
 arisefrom reason and contrivance. To say, th
at all this order in animals andvegetables pr
oceeds ultimately from design, is begging the
 question; norcan that great point be ascerta
ined otherwise than by proving, a priori,both
 that order is, from its nature, inseparably 
attached to thought; andthat it can never of 
itself, or from original unknown principles, 
belongto matter.But further, DEMEA; this obje
ction which you urge can never be made useof 
by CLEANTHES, without renouncing a defence wh
ich he has already madeagainst one of my obje
ctions. When I inquired concerning the cause 
ofthat supreme reason and intelligence into w
hich he resolves every thing;he told me, that
 the impossibility of satisfying such inquiri
es couldnever be admitted as an objection in 
any species of philosophy. "We muststop somew
here", says he; "nor is it ever within the re
ach of humancapacity to explain ultimate caus
es, or show the last connections of anyobject
s. It is sufficient, if any steps, so far as 
we go, are supportedby experience and observa
tion." Now, that vegetation and generation, a
swell as reason, are experienced to be princi
ples of order in nature, isundeniable. If I r
est my system of cosmogony on the former, pre
ferably tothe latter, it is at my choice. The
 matter seems entirely arbitrary. Andwhen CLE
ANTHES asks me what is the cause of my great 
vegetative orgenerative faculty, I am equally
 entitled to ask him the cause of hisgreat re
asoning principle. These questions we have ag
reed to forbear onboth sides; and it is chief
ly his interest on the present occasion tosti
ck to this agreement. Judging by our limited 
and imperfect experience,generation has some 
privileges above reason: for we see every day
 thelatter arise from the former, never the f
ormer from the latter.Compare, I beseech you,
 the consequences on both sides. The world, s
ay I,resembles an animal; therefore it is an 
animal, therefore it arose fromgeneration. Th
e steps, I confess, are wide; yet there is so
me smallappearance of analogy in each step. T
he world, says CLEANTHES, resemblesa machine;
 therefore it is a machine, therefore it aros
e from design. Thesteps are here equally wide
, and the analogy less striking. And if hepre
tends to carry on my hypothesis a step furthe
r, and to infer design orreason from the grea
t principle of generation, on which I insist;
 I may,with better authority, use the same fr
eedom to push further hishypothesis, and infe
r a divine generation or theogony from his pr
incipleof reason. I have at least some faint 
shadow of experience, which is theutmost that
 can ever be attained in the present subject.
 Reason, ininnumerable instances, is observed
 to arise from the principle ofgeneration, an
d never to arise from any other principle.HES
IOD, and all the ancient mythologists, were s
o struck with thisanalogy, that they universa
lly explained the origin of nature from anani
mal birth, and copulation. PLATO too, so far 
as he is intelligible,seems to have adopted s
ome such notion in his TIMAEUS.The BRAHMINS a
ssert, that the world arose from an infinite 
spider, whospun this whole complicated mass f
rom his bowels, and annihilatesafterwards the
 whole or any part of it, by absorbing it aga
in, andresolving it into his own essence. Her
e is a species of cosmogony, whichappears to 
us ridiculous; because a spider is a little c
ontemptibleanimal, whose operations we are ne
ver likely to take for a model of thewhole un
iverse. But still here is a new species of an
alogy, even in ourglobe. And were there a pla
net wholly inhabited by spiders, (which isver
y possible,) this inference would there appea
r as natural andirrefragable as that which in
 our planet ascribes the origin of allthings 
to design and intelligence, as explained by C
LEANTHES. Why anorderly system may not be spu
n from the belly as well as from the brain,it
 will be difficult for him to give a satisfac
tory reason.I must confess, PHILO, replied CL
EANTHES, that of all men living, thetask whic
h you have undertaken, of raising doubts and 
objections, suitsyou best, and seems, in a ma
nner, natural and unavoidable to you. Sogreat
 is your fertility of invention, that I am no
t ashamed toacknowledge myself unable, on a s
udden, to solve regularly suchout-of-the-way 
difficulties as you incessantly start upon me
: though Iclearly see, in general, their fall
acy and error. And I question not, butyou are
 yourself, at present, in the same case, and 
have not the solutionso ready as the objectio
n: while you must be sensible, that common se
nseand reason are entirely against you; and t
hat such whimsies as you havedelivered, may p
uzzle, but never can convince us.PART 8What y
ou ascribe to the fertility of my invention, 
replied PHILO, isentirely owing to the nature
 of the subject. In subjects adapted to thena
rrow compass of human reason, there is common
ly but one determination,which carries probab
ility or conviction with it; and to a man of 
soundjudgement, all other suppositions, but t
hat one, appear entirely absurdand chimerical
. But in such questions as the present, a hun
dredcontradictory views may preserve a kind o
f imperfect analogy; andinvention has here fu
ll scope to exert itself. Without any great e
ffortof thought, I believe that I could, in a
n instant, propose other systemsof cosmogony,
 which would have some faint appearance of tr
uth, though itis a thousand, a million to one
, if either yours or any one of mine bethe tr
ue system.For instance, what if I should revi
ve the old EPICUREAN hypothesis? Thisis commo
nly, and I believe justly, esteemed the most 
absurd system thathas yet been proposed; yet 
I know not whether, with a few alterations, i
tmight not be brought to bear a faint appeara
nce of probability. Insteadof supposing matte
r infinite, as EPICURUS did, let us suppose i
t finite.A finite number of particles is only
 susceptible of finite transpositions:and it 
must happen, in an eternal duration, that eve
ry possible order orposition must be tried an
 infinite number of times. This world, theref
ore,with all its events, even the most minute
, has before been produced anddestroyed, and 
will again be produced and destroyed, without
 any boundsand limitations. No one, who has a
 conception of the powers of infinite,in comp
arison of finite, will ever scruple this dete
rmination.But this supposes, said DEMEA, that
 matter can acquire motion, withoutany volunt
ary agent or first mover.And where is the dif
ficulty, replied PHILO, of that supposition? 
Everyevent, before experience, is equally dif
ficult and incomprehensible; andevery event, 
after experience, is equally easy and intelli
gible. Motion,in many instances, from gravity
, from elasticity, from electricity,begins in
 matter, without any known voluntary agent: a
nd to supposealways, in these cases, an unkno
wn voluntary agent, is mere hypothesis;and hy
pothesis attended with no advantages. The beg
inning of motion inmatter itself is as concei
vable a priori as its communication from mind
and intelligence.Besides, why may not motion 
have been propagated by impulse through allet
ernity, and the same stock of it, or nearly t
he same, be still upheldin the universe? As m
uch is lost by the composition of motion, as 
much isgained by its resolution. And whatever
 the causes are, the fact iscertain, that mat
ter is, and always has been, in continual agi
tation, asfar as human experience or traditio
n reaches. There is not probably, atpresent, 
in the whole universe, one particle of matter
 at absolute rest.And this very consideration
 too, continued PHILO, which we have stumbled
on in the course of the argument, suggests a 
new hypothesis of cosmogony,that is not absol
utely absurd and improbable. Is there a syste
m, anorder, an economy of things, by which ma
tter can preserve that perpetualagitation whi
ch seems essential to it, and yet maintain a 
constancy inthe forms which it produces? Ther
e certainly is such an economy; for thisis ac
tually the case with the present world. The c
ontinual motion ofmatter, therefore, in less 
than infinite transpositions, must producethi
s economy or order; and by its very nature, t
hat order, when onceestablished, supports its
elf, for many ages, if not to eternity. Butwh
erever matter is so poised, arranged, and adj
usted, as to continue inperpetual motion, and
 yet preserve a constancy in the forms, itssi
tuation must, of necessity, have all the same
 appearance of art andcontrivance which we ob
serve at present. All the parts of each form 
musthave a relation to each other, and to the
 whole; and the whole itselfmust have a relat
ion to the other parts of the universe; to th
e elementin which the form subsists; to the m
aterials with which it repairs itswaste and d
ecay; and to every other form which is hostil
e or friendly. Adefect in any of these partic
ulars destroys the form; and the matter ofwhi
ch it is composed is again set loose, and is 
thrown into irregularmotions and fermentation
s, till it unite itself to some other regular
form. If no such form be prepared to receive 
it, and if there be a greatquantity of this c
orrupted matter in the universe, the universe
 itself isentirely disordered; whether it be 
the feeble embryo of a world in itsfirst begi
nnings that is thus destroyed, or the rotten 
carcass of onelanguishing in old age and infi
rmity. In either case, a chaos ensues;till fi
nite, though innumerable revolutions produce 
at last some forms,whose parts and organs are
 so adjusted as to support the forms amidst a
continued succession of matter.Suppose (for w
e shall endeavour to vary the expression), th
at matter werethrown into any position, by a 
blind, unguided force; it is evident thatthis
 first position must, in all probability, be 
the most confused andmost disorderly imaginab
le, without any resemblance to those works of
human contrivance, which, along with a symmet
ry of parts, discover anadjustment of means t
o ends, and a tendency to self-preservation. 
If theactuating force cease after this operat
ion, matter must remain for everin disorder, 
and continue an immense chaos, without any pr
oportion oractivity. But suppose that the act
uating force, whatever it be, stillcontinues 
in matter, this first position will immediate
ly give place to asecond, which will likewise
 in all probability be as disorderly as thefi
rst, and so on through many successions of ch
anges and revolutions. Noparticular order or 
position ever continues a moment unaltered. T
heoriginal force, still remaining in activity
, gives a perpetualrestlessness to matter. Ev
ery possible situation is produced, andinstan
tly destroyed. If a glimpse or dawn of order 
appears for a moment,it is instantly hurried 
away, and confounded, by that never-ceasing f
orcewhich actuates every part of matter.Thus 
the universe goes on for many ages in a conti
nued succession ofchaos and disorder. But is 
it not possible that it may settle at last, s
oas not to lose its motion and active force (
for that we have supposedinherent in it), yet
 so as to preserve an uniformity of appearanc
e,amidst the continual motion and fluctuation
 of its parts? This we find tobe the case wit
h the universe at present. Every individual i
s perpetuallychanging, and every part of ever
y individual; and yet the whole remains,in ap
pearance, the same. May we not hope for such 
a position, or ratherbe assured of it, from t
he eternal revolutions of unguided matter; an
dmay not this account for all the appearing w
isdom and contrivance whichis in the universe
? Let us contemplate the subject a little, an
d we shallfind, that this adjustment, if atta
ined by matter of a seeming stabilityin the f
orms, with a real and perpetual revolution or
 motion of parts,affords a plausible, if not 
a true solution of the difficulty.It is in va
in, therefore, to insist upon the uses of the
 parts in animalsor vegetables, and their cur
ious adjustment to each other. I would fainkn
ow, how an animal could subsist, unless its p
arts were so adjusted? Dowe not find, that it
 immediately perishes whenever this adjustmen
tceases, and that its matter corrupting tries
 some new form? It happensindeed, that the pa
rts of the world are so well adjusted, that s
omeregular form immediately lays claim to thi
s corrupted matter: and if itwere not so, cou
ld the world subsist? Must it not dissolve as
 well as theanimal, and pass through new posi
tions and situations, till in great, butfinit
e succession, it falls at last into the prese
nt or some such order?It is well, replied CLE
ANTHES, you told us, that this hypothesis was
suggested on a sudden, in the course of the a
rgument. Had you had leisureto examine it, yo
u would soon have perceived the insuperable o
bjectionsto which it is exposed. No form, you
 say, can subsist, unless it possessthose pow
ers and organs requisite for its subsistence:
 some new order oreconomy must be tried, and 
so on, without intermission; till at last som
eorder, which can support and maintain itself
, is fallen upon. Butaccording to this hypoth
esis, whence arise the many conveniences anda
dvantages which men and all animals possess? 
Two eyes, two ears, are notabsolutely necessa
ry for the subsistence of the species. Human 
race mighthave been propagated and preserved,
 without horses, dogs, cows, sheep,and those 
innumerable fruits and products which serve t
o our satisfactionand enjoyment. If no camels
 had been created for the use of man in thesa
ndy deserts of AFRICA and ARABIA, would the w
orld have been dissolved?If no lodestone had 
been framed to give that wonderful and useful
direction to the needle, would human society 
and the human kind have beenimmediately extin
guished? Though the maxims of Nature be in ge
neral veryfrugal, yet instances of this kind 
are far from being rare; and any oneof them i
s a sufficient proof of design, and of a bene
volent design,which gave rise to the order an
d arrangement of the universe.At least, you m
ay safely infer, said PHILO, that the foregoi
ng hypothesisis so far incomplete and imperfe
ct, which I shall not scruple to allow.But ca
n we ever reasonably expect greater success i
n any attempts of thisnature? Or can we ever 
hope to erect a system of cosmogony, that wil
l beliable to no exceptions, and will contain
 no circumstance repugnant toour limited and 
imperfect experience of the analogy of Nature
? Yourtheory itself cannot surely pretend to 
any such advantage, even thoughyou have run i
nto Anthropomorphism, the better to preserve 
a conformityto common experience. Let us once
 more put it to trial. In all instanceswhich 
we have ever seen, ideas are copied from real
 objects, and areectypal, not archetypal, to 
express myself in learned terms: You reverset
his order, and give thought the precedence. I
n all instances which wehave ever seen, thoug
ht has no influence upon matter, except where
 thatmatter is so conjoined with it as to hav
e an equal reciprocal influenceupon it. No an
imal can move immediately any thing but the m
embers of itsown body; and indeed, the equali
ty of action and reaction seems to be anunive
rsal law of nature: But your theory implies a
 contradiction to thisexperience. These insta
nces, with many more, which it were easy toco
llect, (particularly the supposition of a min
d or system of thoughtthat is eternal, or, in
 other words, an animal ingenerable and immor
tal);these instances, I say, may teach all of
 us sobriety in condemning eachother, and let
 us see, that as no system of this kind ought
 ever to bereceived from a slight analogy, so
 neither ought any to be rejected onaccount o
f a small incongruity. For that is an inconve
nience from whichwe can justly pronounce no o
ne to be exempted.All religious systems, it i
s confessed, are subject to great andinsupera
ble difficulties. Each disputant triumphs in 
his turn; while hecarries on an offensive war
, and exposes the absurdities, barbarities,an
d pernicious tenets of his antagonist. But al
l of them, on the whole,prepare a complete tr
iumph for the Sceptic; who tells them, that n
osystem ought ever to be embraced with regard
 to such subjects: For thisplain reason, that
 no absurdity ought ever to be assented to wi
th regardto any subject. A total suspense of 
judgement is here our only reasonableresource
. And if every attack, as is commonly observe
d, and no defence,among Theologians, is succe
ssful; how complete must be his victory, whor
emains always, with all mankind, on the offen
sive, and has himself nofixed station or abid
ing city, which he is ever, on any occasion, 
obligedto defend?PART 9But if so many difficu
lties attend the argument a posteriori, said 
DEMEA,had we not better adhere to that simple
 and sublime argument a priori,which, by offe
ring to us infallible demonstration, cuts off
 at once alldoubt and difficulty? By this arg
ument, too, we may prove the infinity ofthe D
ivine attributes, which, I am afraid, can nev
er be ascertained withcertainty from any othe
r topic. For how can an effect, which either 
isfinite, or, for aught we know, may be so; h
ow can such an effect, I say,prove an infinit
e cause? The unity too of the Divine Nature, 
it is verydifficult, if not absolutely imposs
ible, to deduce merely fromcontemplating the 
works of nature; nor will the uniformity alon
e of theplan, even were it allowed, give us a
ny assurance of that attribute.Whereas the ar
gument a priori ...You seem to reason, DEMEA,
 interposed CLEANTHES, as if those advantages
and conveniences in the abstract argument wer
e full proofs of itssolidity. But it is first
 proper, in my opinion, to determine whatargu
ment of this nature you choose to insist on; 
and we shall afterwards,from itself, better t
han from its useful consequences, endeavour t
odetermine what value we ought to put upon it
.The argument, replied DEMEA, which I would i
nsist on, is the common one.Whatever exists m
ust have a cause or reason of its existence; 
it beingabsolutely impossible for any thing t
o produce itself, or be the cause ofits own e
xistence. In mounting up, therefore, from eff
ects to causes, wemust either go on in tracin
g an infinite succession, without any ultimat
ecause at all; or must at last have recourse 
to some ultimate cause, thatis necessarily ex
istent: Now, that the first supposition is ab
surd, maybe thus proved. In the infinite chai
n or succession of causes andeffects, each si
ngle effect is determined to exist by the pow
er andefficacy of that cause which immediatel
y preceded; but the whole eternalchain or suc
cession, taken together, is not determined or
 caused by anything; and yet it is evident th
at it requires a cause or reason, as muchas a
ny particular object which begins to exist in
 time. The question isstill reasonable, why t
his particular succession of causes existed f
rometernity, and not any other succession, or
 no succession at all. If therebe no necessar
ily existent being, any supposition which can
 be formed isequally possible; nor is there a
ny more absurdity in Nothing's havingexisted 
from eternity, than there is in that successi
on of causes whichconstitutes the universe. W
hat was it, then, which determined Somethingt
o exist rather than Nothing, and bestowed bei
ng on a particularpossibility, exclusive of t
he rest? External causes, there are supposedt
o be none. Chance is a word without a meaning
. Was it Nothing? But thatcan never produce a
ny thing. We must, therefore, have recourse t
o anecessarily existent Being, who carries th
e REASON of his existence inhimself, and who 
cannot be supposed not to exist, without an e
xpresscontradiction. There is, consequently, 
such a Being; that is, there is aDeity.I shal
l not leave it to PHILO, said CLEANTHES, thou
gh I know that thestarting objections is his 
chief delight, to point out the weakness ofth
is metaphysical reasoning. It seems to me so 
obviously ill-grounded,and at the same time o
f so little consequence to the cause of true 
pietyand religion, that I shall myself ventur
e to show the fallacy of it.I shall begin wit
h observing, that there is an evident absurdi
ty inpretending to demonstrate a matter of fa
ct, or to prove it by anyarguments a priori. 
Nothing is demonstrable, unless the contrary 
impliesa contradiction. Nothing, that is dist
inctly conceivable, implies acontradiction. W
hatever we conceive as existent, we can also 
conceive asnon-existent. There is no being, t
herefore, whose non-existence implies acontra
diction. Consequently there is no being, whos
e existence isdemonstrable. I propose this ar
gument as entirely decisive, and amwilling to
 rest the whole controversy upon it.It is pre
tended that the Deity is a necessarily existe
nt being; and thisnecessity of his existence 
is attempted to be explained by asserting,tha
t if we knew his whole essence or nature, we 
should perceive it to beas impossible for him
 not to exist, as for twice two not to be fou
r. Butit is evident that this can never happe
n, while our faculties remain thesame as at p
resent. It will still be possible for us, at 
any time, toconceive the non-existence of wha
t we formerly conceived to exist; norcan the 
mind ever lie under a necessity of supposing 
any object to remainalways in being; in the s
ame manner as we lie under a necessity of alw
aysconceiving twice two to be four. The words
, therefore, necessaryexistence, have no mean
ing; or, which is the same thing, none that i
sconsistent.But further, why may not the mate
rial universe be the necessarilyexistent Bein
g, according to this pretended explication of
 necessity? Wedare not affirm that we know al
l the qualities of matter; and for aughtwe ca
n determine, it may contain some qualities, w
hich, were they known,would make its non-exis
tence appear as great a contradiction as that
twice two is five. I find only one argument e
mployed to prove, that thematerial world is n
ot the necessarily existent Being: and this a
rgumentis derived from the contingency both o
f the matter and the form of theworld. "Any p
article of matter," it is said[]Dr. Clarke, "
may be conceivedto be annihilated; and any fo
rm may be conceived to be altered. Such anann
ihilation or alteration, therefore, is not im
possible." But it seemsa great partiality not
 to perceive, that the same argument extendse
qually to the Deity, so far as we have any co
nception of him; and thatthe mind can at leas
t imagine him to be non-existent, or his attr
ibutesto be altered. It must be some unknown,
 inconceivable qualities, whichcan make his n
on-existence appear impossible, or his attrib
utesunalterable: And no reason can be assigne
d, why these qualities may notbelong to matte
r. As they are altogether unknown and inconce
ivable, theycan never be proved incompatible 
with it.Add to this, that in tracing an etern
al succession of objects, it seemsabsurd to i
nquire for a general cause or first author. H
ow can any thing,that exists from eternity, h
ave a cause, since that relation implies apri
ority in time, and a beginning of existence?I
n such a chain, too, or succession of objects
, each part is caused bythat which preceded i
t, and causes that which succeeds it. Where t
hen isthe difficulty? But the whole, you say,
 wants a cause. I answer, that theuniting of 
these parts into a whole, like the uniting of
 several distinctcountries into one kingdom, 
or several distinct members into one body, is
performed merely by an arbitrary act of the m
ind, and has no influence onthe nature of thi
ngs. Did I show you the particular causes of 
eachindividual in a collection of twenty part
icles of matter, I should thinkit very unreas
onable, should you afterwards ask me, what wa
s the cause ofthe whole twenty. This is suffi
ciently explained in explaining the causeof t
he parts.Though the reasonings which you have
 urged, CLEANTHES, may well excuseme, said PH
ILO, from starting any further difficulties, 
yet I cannotforbear insisting still upon anot
her topic. It is observed byarithmeticians, t
hat the products of 9, compose always either 
9, or somelesser product of 9, if you add tog
ether all the characters of which anyof the f
ormer products is composed. Thus, of 18, 27, 
36, which areproducts of 9, you make 9 by add
ing 1 to 8, 2 to 7, 3 to 6. Thus, 369 isa pro
duct also of 9; and if you add 3, 6, and 9, y
ou make 18, a lesserproduct of 9. To a superf
icial observer, so wonderful a regularity may
be admired as the effect either of chance or 
design: but a skilfulalgebraist immediately c
oncludes it to be the work of necessity, andd
emonstrates, that it must for ever result fro
m the nature of thesenumbers. Is it not proba
ble, I ask, that the whole economy of theuniv
erse is conducted by a like necessity, though
 no human algebra canfurnish a key which solv
es the difficulty? And instead of admiring th
eorder of natural beings, may it not happen, 
that, could we penetrate intothe intimate nat
ure of bodies, we should clearly see why it w
asabsolutely impossible they could ever admit
 of any other disposition? Sodangerous is it 
to introduce this idea of necessity into the 
presentquestion! and so naturally does it aff
ord an inference directly oppositeto the reli
gious hypothesis!But dropping all these abstr
actions, continued PHILO, and confiningoursel
ves to more familiar topics, I shall venture 
to add an observation,that the argument a pri
ori has seldom been found very convincing, ex
ceptto people of a metaphysical head, who hav
e accustomed themselves toabstract reasoning,
 and who, finding from mathematics, that theu
nderstanding frequently leads to truth throug
h obscurity, and, contraryto first appearance
s, have transferred the same habit of thinkin
g tosubjects where it ought not to have place
. Other people, even of goodsense and the bes
t inclined to religion, feel always some defi
ciency insuch arguments, though they are not 
perhaps able to explain distinctlywhere it li
es; a certain proof that men ever did, and ev
er will derivetheir religion from other sourc
es than from this species of reasoning.PART 1
0It is my opinion, I own, replied DEMEA, that
 each man feels, in a manner,the truth of rel
igion within his own breast, and, from a cons
ciousness ofhis imbecility and misery, rather
 than from any reasoning, is led to seekprote
ction from that Being, on whom he and all nat
ure is dependent. Soanxious or so tedious are
 even the best scenes of life, that futurity 
isstill the object of all our hopes and fears
. We incessantly look forward,and endeavour, 
by prayers, adoration, and sacrifice, to appe
ase thoseunknown powers, whom we find, by exp
erience, so able to afflict andoppress us. Wr
etched creatures that we are! what resource f
or us amidstthe innumerable ills of life, did
 not religion suggest some methods ofatonemen
t, and appease those terrors with which we ar
e incessantlyagitated and tormented?I am inde
ed persuaded, said PHILO, that the best, and 
indeed the onlymethod of bringing every one t
o a due sense of religion, is by justrepresen
tations of the misery and wickedness of men. 
And for that purposea talent of eloquence and
 strong imagery is more requisite than that o
freasoning and argument. For is it necessary 
to prove what every one feelswithin himself? 
It is only necessary to make us feel it, if p
ossible,more intimately and sensibly.The peop
le, indeed, replied DEMEA, are sufficiently c
onvinced of thisgreat and melancholy truth. T
he miseries of life; the unhappiness of man;t
he general corruptions of our nature; the uns
atisfactory enjoyment ofpleasures, riches, ho
nours; these phrases have become almost prove
rbialin all languages. And who can doubt of w
hat all men declare from theirown immediate f
eeling and experience?In this point, said PHI
LO, the learned are perfectly agreed with the
vulgar; and in all letters, sacred and profan
e, the topic of human miseryhas been insisted
 on with the most pathetic eloquence that sor
row andmelancholy could inspire. The poets, w
ho speak from sentiment, without asystem, and
 whose testimony has therefore the more autho
rity, abound inimages of this nature. From Ho
mer down to Dr. Young, the whole inspiredtrib
e have ever been sensible, that no other repr
esentation of thingswould suit the feeling an
d observation of each individual.As to author
ities, replied DEMEA, you need not seek them.
 Look round thislibrary of CLEANTHES. I shall
 venture to affirm, that, except authors ofpa
rticular sciences, such as chemistry or botan
y, who have no occasion totreat of human life
, there is scarce one of those innumerable wr
iters,from whom the sense of human misery has
 not, in some passage or other,extorted a com
plaint and confession of it. At least, the ch
ance isentirely on that side; and no one auth
or has ever, so far as I canrecollect, been s
o extravagant as to deny it.There you must ex
cuse me, said PHILO: LEIBNIZ has denied it; a
nd isperhaps the first [That sentiment had be
en maintained by Dr. King and somefew others 
before Leibniz; though by none of so great a 
fame as thatGerman philosopher] who ventured 
upon so bold and paradoxical an opinion;at le
ast, the first who made it essential to his p
hilosophical system.And by being the first, r
eplied DEMEA, might he not have been sensible
 ofhis error? For is this a subject in which 
philosophers can propose tomake discoveries e
specially in so late an age? And can any man 
hope by asimple denial (for the subject scarc
ely admits of reasoning), to beardown the uni
ted testimony of mankind, founded on sense an
d consciousness?And why should man, added he,
 pretend to an exemption from the lot of allo
ther animals? The whole earth, believe me, PH
ILO, is cursed andpolluted. A perpetual war i
s kindled amongst all living creatures.Necess
ity, hunger, want, stimulate the strong and c
ourageous: Fear,anxiety, terror, agitate the 
weak and infirm. The first entrance intolife 
gives anguish to the new-born infant and to i
ts wretched parent:Weakness, impotence, distr
ess, attend each stage of that life: and it i
sat last finished in agony and horror.Observe
 too, says PHILO, the curious artifices of Na
ture, in order toembitter the life of every l
iving being. The stronger prey upon theweaker
, and keep them in perpetual terror and anxie
ty. The weaker too, intheir turn, often prey 
upon the stronger, and vex and molest them wi
thoutrelaxation. Consider that innumerable ra
ce of insects, which either arebred on the bo
dy of each animal, or, flying about, infix th
eir stings inhim. These insects have others s
till less than themselves, which tormentthem.
 And thus on each hand, before and behind, ab
ove and below, everyanimal is surrounded with
 enemies, which incessantly seek his misery a
nddestruction.Man alone, said DEMEA, seems to
 be, in part, an exception to this rule.For b
y combination in society, he can easily maste
r lions, tigers, andbears, whose greater stre
ngth and agility naturally enable them to pre
yupon him.On the contrary, it is here chiefly
, cried PHILO, that the uniform andequal maxi
ms of Nature are most apparent. Man, it is tr
ue, can, bycombination, surmount all his real
 enemies, and become master of thewhole anima
l creation: but does he not immediately raise
 up to himselfimaginary enemies, the demons o
f his fancy, who haunt him withsuperstitious 
terrors, and blast every enjoyment of life? H
is pleasure,as he imagines, becomes, in their
 eyes, a crime: his food and repose givethem 
umbrage and offence: his very sleep and dream
s furnish new materialsto anxious fear: and e
ven death, his refuge from every other ill,pr
esents only the dread of endless and innumera
ble woes. Nor does thewolf molest more the ti
mid flock, than superstition does the anxious
breast of wretched mortals.Besides, consider,
 DEMEA: This very society, by which we surmou
nt thosewild beasts, our natural enemies; wha
t new enemies does it not raise tous? What wo
e and misery does it not occasion? Man is the
 greatest enemyof man. Oppression, injustice,
 contempt, contumely, violence, sedition,war,
 calumny, treachery, fraud; by these they mut
ually torment eachother; and they would soon 
dissolve that society which they had formed,w
ere it not for the dread of still greater ill
s, which must attend theirseparation.But thou
gh these external insults, said DEMEA, from a
nimals, from men,from all the elements, which
 assault us, form a frightful catalogue ofwoe
s, they are nothing in comparison of those wh
ich arise withinourselves, from the distemper
ed condition of our mind and body. How manyli
e under the lingering torment of diseases? He
ar the patheticenumeration of the great poet.
    Intestine stone and ulcer, colic-pangs,  
  Demoniac frenzy, moping melancholy,    And 
moon-struck madness, pining atrophy,    Maras
mus, and wide-wasting pestilence.    Dire was
 the tossing, deep the groans: despair    Ten
ded the sick, busiest from couch to couch.   
 And over them triumphant death his dart    S
hook: but delay'd to strike, though oft invok
'd    With vows, as their chief good and fina
l hope.The disorders of the mind, continued D
EMEA, though more secret, are notperhaps less
 dismal and vexatious. Remorse, shame, anguis
h, rage,disappointment, anxiety, fear, deject
ion, despair; who has ever passedthrough life
 without cruel inroads from these tormentors?
 How many havescarcely ever felt any better s
ensations? Labour and poverty, so abhorredby 
every one, are the certain lot of the far gre
ater number; and thosefew privileged persons,
 who enjoy ease and opulence, never reachcont
entment or true felicity. All the goods of li
fe united would not makea very happy man; but
 all the ills united would make a wretch inde
ed; andany one of them almost (and who can be
 free from every one?) nay oftenthe absence o
f one good (and who can possess all?) is suff
icient torender life ineligible.Were a strang
er to drop on a sudden into this world, I wou
ld show him, asa specimen of its ills, a hosp
ital full of diseases, a prison crowdedwith m
alefactors and debtors, a field of battle str
ewed with carcasses, afleet foundering in the
 ocean, a nation languishing under tyranny,fa
mine, or pestilence. To turn the gay side of 
life to him, and give hima notion of its plea
sures; whither should I conduct him? to a bal
l, to anopera, to court? He might justly thin
k, that I was only showing him adiversity of 
distress and sorrow.There is no evading such 
striking instances, said PHILO, but byapologi
es, which still further aggravate the charge.
 Why have all men, Iask, in all ages, complai
ned incessantly of the miseries of life?...Th
ey have no just reason, says one: these compl
aints proceed only fromtheir discontented, re
pining, anxious disposition...And can therepo
ssibly, I reply, be a more certain foundation
 of misery, than such awretched temper?But if
 they were really as unhappy as they pretend,
 says my antagonist,why do they remain in lif
e?...    Not satisfied with life, afraid of d
eath.This is the secret chain, say I, that ho
lds us. We are terrified, notbribed to the co
ntinuance of our existence.It is only a false
 delicacy, he may insist, which a few refined
 spiritsindulge, and which has spread these c
omplaints among the whole race ofmankind. . .
 . And what is this delicacy, I ask, which yo
u blame? Is itany thing but a greater sensibi
lity to all the pleasures and pains oflife? a
nd if the man of a delicate, refined temper, 
by being so much morealive than the rest of t
he world, is only so much more unhappy, whatj
udgement must we form in general of human lif
e?Let men remain at rest, says our adversary,
 and they will be easy. Theyare willing artif
icers of their own misery. . . . No! reply I:
 an anxiouslanguor follows their repose; disa
ppointment, vexation, trouble, theiractivity 
and ambition.I can observe something like wha
t you mention in some others, repliedCLEANTHE
S: but I confess I feel little or nothing of 
it in myself, andhope that it is not so commo
n as you represent it.If you feel not human m
isery yourself, cried DEMEA, I congratulate y
ou onso happy a singularity. Others, seemingl
y the most prosperous, have notbeen ashamed t
o vent their complaints in the most melanchol
y strains. Letus attend to the great, the for
tunate emperor, CHARLES V, when, tiredwith hu
man grandeur, he resigned all his extensive d
ominions into thehands of his son. In the las
t harangue which he made on that memorableocc
asion, he publicly avowed, that the greatest 
prosperities which he hadever enjoyed, had be
en mixed with so many adversities, that he mi
ghttruly say he had never enjoyed any satisfa
ction or contentment. But didthe retired life
, in which he sought for shelter, afford him 
any greaterhappiness? If we may credit his so
n's account, his repentance commencedthe very
 day of his resignation.CICERO's fortune, fro
m small beginnings, rose to the greatest lust
re andrenown; yet what pathetic complaints of
 the ills of life do his familiarletters, as 
well as philosophical discourses, contain? An
d suitably tohis own experience, he introduce
s CATO, the great, the fortunate CATO,protest
ing in his old age, that had he a new life in
 his offer, he wouldreject the present.Ask yo
urself, ask any of your acquaintance, whether
 they would live overagain the last ten or tw
enty years of their life. No! but the nexttwe
nty, they say, will be better:    And from th
e dregs of life, hope to receive    What the 
first sprightly running could not give.Thus a
t last they find (such is the greatness of hu
man misery, itreconciles even contradictions)
, that they complain at once of theshortness 
of life, and of its vanity and sorrow.And is 
it possible, CLEANTHES, said PHILO, that afte
r all thesereflections, and infinitely more, 
which might be suggested, you can stillpersev
ere in your Anthropomorphism, and assert the 
moral attributes ofthe Deity, his justice, be
nevolence, mercy, and rectitude, to be of the
same nature with these virtues in human creat
ures? His power we allow isinfinite: whatever
 he wills is executed: but neither man nor an
y otheranimal is happy: therefore he does not
 will their happiness. His wisdomis infinite:
 He is never mistaken in choosing the means t
o any end: Butthe course of Nature tends not 
to human or animal felicity: therefore itis n
ot established for that purpose. Through the 
whole compass of humanknowledge, there are no
 inferences more certain and infallible thant
hese. In what respect, then, do his benevolen
ce and mercy resemble thebenevolence and merc
y of men?EPICURUS's old questions are yet una
nswered. Is he willing to prevent evil,but no
t able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but 
not willing? then is hemalevolent. Is he both
 able and willing? whence then is evil?You as
cribe, CLEANTHES (and I believe justly), a pu
rpose and intention toNature. But what, I bes
eech you, is the object of that curious artif
iceand machinery, which she has displayed in 
all animals? The preservationalone of individ
uals, and propagation of the species. It seem
s enough forher purpose, if such a rank be ba
rely upheld in the universe, without anycare 
or concern for the happiness of the members t
hat compose it. Noresource for this purpose: 
no machinery, in order merely to give pleasur
eor ease: no fund of pure joy and contentment
: no indulgence, without somewant or necessit
y accompanying it. At least, the few phenomen
a of thisnature are overbalanced by opposite 
phenomena of still greater importance.Our sen
se of music, harmony, and indeed beauty of al
l kinds, givessatisfaction, without being abs
olutely necessary to the preservation andprop
agation of the species. But what racking pain
s, on the other hand,arise from gouts, gravel
s, megrims, toothaches, rheumatisms, where th
einjury to the animal machinery is either sma
ll or incurable? Mirth,laughter, play, frolic
, seem gratuitous satisfactions, which have n
ofurther tendency: spleen, melancholy, discon
tent, superstition, are painsof the same natu
re. How then does the Divine benevolence disp
lay itself,in the sense of you Anthropomorphi
tes? None but we Mystics, as you werepleased 
to call us, can account for this strange mixt
ure of phenomena, byderiving it from attribut
es, infinitely perfect, but incomprehensible.
And have you at last, said CLEANTHES smiling,
 betrayed your intentions,PHILO? Your long ag
reement with DEMEA did indeed a little surpri
se me;but I find you were all the while erect
ing a concealed battery againstme. And I must
 confess, that you have now fallen upon a sub
ject worthy ofyour noble spirit of opposition
 and controversy. If you can make out thepres
ent point, and prove mankind to be unhappy or
 corrupted, there is anend at once of all rel
igion. For to what purpose establish the natu
ralattributes of the Deity, while the moral a
re still doubtful anduncertain?You take umbra
ge very easily, replied DEMEA, at opinions th
e mostinnocent, and the most generally receiv
ed, even amongst the religious anddevout them
selves: and nothing can be more surprising th
an to find atopic like this, concerning the w
ickedness and misery of man, chargedwith no l
ess than Atheism and profaneness. Have not al
l pious divines andpreachers, who have indulg
ed their rhetoric on so fertile a subject; ha
vethey not easily, I say, given a solution of
 any difficulties which mayattend it? This wo
rld is but a point in comparison of the unive
rse; thislife but a moment in comparison of e
ternity. The present evil phenomena,therefore
, are rectified in other regions, and in some
 future period ofexistence. And the eyes of m
en, being then opened to larger views ofthing
s, see the whole connection of general laws; 
and trace withadoration, the benevolence and 
rectitude of the Deity, through all themazes 
and intricacies of his providence.No! replied
 CLEANTHES, No! These arbitrary suppositions 
can never beadmitted, contrary to matter of f
act, visible and uncontroverted. Whencecan an
y cause be known but from its known effects? 
Whence can anyhypothesis be proved but from t
he apparent phenomena? To establish onehypoth
esis upon another, is building entirely in th
e air; and the utmostwe ever attain, by these
 conjectures and fictions, is to ascertain th
ebare possibility of our opinion; but never c
an we, upon such terms,establish its reality.
The only method of supporting Divine benevole
nce, and it is what Iwillingly embrace, is to
 deny absolutely the misery and wickedness of
man. Your representations are exaggerated; yo
ur melancholy views mostlyfictitious; your in
ferences contrary to fact and experience. Hea
lth ismore common than sickness; pleasure tha
n pain; happiness than misery. Andfor one vex
ation which we meet with, we attain, upon com
putation, ahundred enjoyments.Admitting your 
position, replied PHILO, which yet is extreme
ly doubtful,you must at the same time allow, 
that if pain be less frequent thanpleasure, i
t is infinitely more violent and durable. One
 hour of it isoften able to outweigh a day, a
 week, a month of our common insipidenjoyment
s; and how many days, weeks, and months, are 
passed by severalin the most acute torments? 
Pleasure, scarcely in one instance, is everab
le to reach ecstasy and rapture; and in no on
e instance can it continuefor any time at its
 highest pitch and altitude. The spirits evap
orate,the nerves relax, the fabric is disorde
red, and the enjoyment quicklydegenerates int
o fatigue and uneasiness. But pain often, goo
d God, howoften! rises to torture and agony; 
and the longer it continues, itbecomes still 
more genuine agony and torture. Patience is e
xhausted,courage languishes, melancholy seize
s us, and nothing terminates ourmisery but th
e removal of its cause, or another event, whi
ch is the solecure of all evil, but which, fr
om our natural folly, we regard with stillgre
ater horror and consternation.But not to insi
st upon these topics, continued PHILO, though
 mostobvious, certain, and important; I must 
use the freedom to admonish you,CLEANTHES, th
at you have put the controversy upon a most d
angerous issue,and are unawares introducing a
 total scepticism into the most essentialarti
cles of natural and revealed theology. What! 
no method of fixing ajust foundation for reli
gion, unless we allow the happiness of humanl
ife, and maintain a continued existence even 
in this world, with all ourpresent pains, inf
irmities, vexations, and follies, to be eligi
ble anddesirable! But this is contrary to eve
ry one's feeling and experience: Itis contrar
y to an authority so established as nothing c
an subvert. Nodecisive proofs can ever be pro
duced against this authority; nor is itpossib
le for you to compute, estimate, and compare,
 all the pains and allthe pleasures in the li
ves of all men and of all animals: And thus, 
byyour resting the whole system of religion o
n a point, which, from itsvery nature, must f
or ever be uncertain, you tacitly confess, th
at thatsystem is equally uncertain.But allowi
ng you what never will be believed, at least 
what you neverpossibly can prove, that animal
, or at least human happiness, in thislife, e
xceeds its misery, you have yet done nothing:
 For this is not, byany means, what we expect
 from infinite power, infinite wisdom, andinf
inite goodness. Why is there any misery at al
l in the world? Not bychance surely. From som
e cause then. Is it from the intention of the
Deity? But he is perfectly benevolent. Is it 
contrary to his intention?But he is almighty.
 Nothing can shake the solidity of this reaso
ning, soshort, so clear, so decisive; except 
we assert, that these subjectsexceed all huma
n capacity, and that our common measures of t
ruth andfalsehood are not applicable to them;
 a topic which I have all alonginsisted on, b
ut which you have, from the beginning, reject
ed with scornand indignation.But I will be co
ntented to retire still from this entrenchmen
t, for Ideny that you can ever force me in it
. I will allow, that pain or miseryin man is 
compatible with infinite power and goodness i
n the Deity, evenin your sense of these attri
butes: What are you advanced by all theseconc
essions? A mere possible compatibility is not
 sufficient. You mustprove these pure, unmixe
d, and uncontrollable attributes from the pre
sentmixed and confused phenomena, and from th
ese alone. A hopefulundertaking! Were the phe
nomena ever so pure and unmixed, yet beingfin
ite, they would be insufficient for that purp
ose. How much more, wherethey are also so jar
ring and discordant!Here, CLEANTHES, I find m
yself at ease in my argument. Here I triumph.
Formerly, when we argued concerning the natur
al attributes ofintelligence and design, I ne
eded all my sceptical and metaphysicalsubtlet
y to elude your grasp. In many views of the u
niverse, and of itsparts, particularly the la
tter, the beauty and fitness of final causess
trike us with such irresistible force, that a
ll objections appear (whatI believe they real
ly are) mere cavils and sophisms; nor can we 
thenimagine how it was ever possible for us t
o repose any weight on them. Butthere is no v
iew of human life, or of the condition of man
kind, fromwhich, without the greatest violenc
e, we can infer the moral attributes,or learn
 that infinite benevolence, conjoined with in
finite power andinfinite wisdom, which we mus
t discover by the eyes of faith alone. It isy
our turn now to tug the labouring oar, and to
 support your philosophicalsubtleties against
 the dictates of plain reason and experience.
PART 11I scruple not to allow, said CLEANTHES
, that I have been apt to suspectthe frequent
 repetition of the word infinite, which we me
et with in alltheological writers, to savour 
more of panegyric than of philosophy; andthat
 any purposes of reasoning, and even of relig
ion, would be betterserved, were we to rest c
ontented with more accurate and more moderate
expressions. The terms, admirable, excellent,
 superlatively great, wise,and holy; these su
fficiently fill the imaginations of men; and 
any thingbeyond, besides that it leads into a
bsurdities, has no influence on theaffections
 or sentiments. Thus, in the present subject,
 if we abandon allhuman analogy, as seems you
r intention, DEMEA, I am afraid we abandon al
lreligion, and retain no conception of the gr
eat object of our adoration.If we preserve hu
man analogy, we must for ever find it impossi
ble toreconcile any mixture of evil in the un
iverse with infinite attributes;much less can
 we ever prove the latter from the former. Bu
t supposing theAuthor of Nature to be finitel
y perfect, though far exceeding mankind, asat
isfactory account may then be given of natura
l and moral evil, andevery untoward phenomeno
n be explained and adjusted. A less evil may 
thenbe chosen, in order to avoid a greater; i
nconveniences be submitted to,in order to rea
ch a desirable end; and in a word, benevolenc
e, regulatedby wisdom, and limited by necessi
ty, may produce just such a world as theprese
nt. You, PHILO, who are so prompt at starting
 views, andreflections, and analogies, I woul
d gladly hear, at length, withoutinterruption
, your opinion of this new theory; and if it 
deserve ourattention, we may afterwards, at m
ore leisure, reduce it into form.My sentiment
s, replied PHILO, are not worth being made a 
mystery of; andtherefore, without any ceremon
y, I shall deliver what occurs to me withrega
rd to the present subject. It must, I think, 
be allowed, that if avery limited intelligenc
e, whom we shall suppose utterly unacquainted
with the universe, were assured, that it were
 the production of a verygood, wise, and powe
rful Being, however finite, he would, from hi
sconjectures, form beforehand a different not
ion of it from what we findit to be by experi
ence; nor would he ever imagine, merely from 
theseattributes of the cause, of which he is 
informed, that the effect couldbe so full of 
vice and misery and disorder, as it appears i
n this life.Supposing now, that this person w
ere brought into the world, stillassured that
 it was the workmanship of such a sublime and
 benevolentBeing; he might, perhaps, be surpr
ised at the disappointment; but wouldnever re
tract his former belief, if founded on any ve
ry solid argument;since such a limited intell
igence must be sensible of his own blindnessa
nd ignorance, and must allow, that there may 
be many solutions of thosephenomena, which wi
ll for ever escape his comprehension. But sup
posing,which is the real case with regard to 
man, that this creature is notantecedently co
nvinced of a supreme intelligence, benevolent
, andpowerful, but is left to gather such a b
elief from the appearances ofthings; this ent
irely alters the case, nor will he ever find 
any reasonfor such a conclusion. He may be fu
lly convinced of the narrow limits ofhis unde
rstanding; but this will not help him in form
ing an inferenceconcerning the goodness of su
perior powers, since he must form thatinferen
ce from what he knows, not from what he is ig
norant of. The moreyou exaggerate his weaknes
s and ignorance, the more diffident you rende
rhim, and give him the greater suspicion that
 such subjects are beyond thereach of his fac
ulties. You are obliged, therefore, to reason
 with himmerely from the known phenomena, and
 to drop every arbitrary suppositionor conjec
ture.Did I show you a house or palace, where 
there was not one apartmentconvenient or agre
eable; where the windows, doors, fires, passa
ges,stairs, and the whole economy of the buil
ding, were the source of noise,confusion, fat
igue, darkness, and the extremes of heat and 
cold; youwould certainly blame the contrivanc
e, without any further examination.The archit
ect would in vain display his subtlety, and p
rove to you, thatif this door or that window 
were altered, greater ills would ensue. Whath
e says may be strictly true: The alteration o
f one particular, while theother parts of the
 building remain, may only augment the inconv
eniences.But still you would assert in genera
l, that, if the architect had hadskill and go
od intentions, he might have formed such a pl
an of the whole,and might have adjusted the p
arts in such a manner, as would haveremedied 
all or most of these inconveniences. His igno
rance, or even yourown ignorance of such a pl
an, will never convince you of theimpossibili
ty of it. If you find any inconveniences and 
deformities inthe building, you will always, 
without entering into any detail, condemnthe 
architect.In short, I repeat the question: Is
 the world, considered in general, andas it a
ppears to us in this life, different from wha
t a man, or such alimited being, would, befor
ehand, expect from a very powerful, wise, and
benevolent Deity? It must be strange prejudic
e to assert the contrary.And from thence I co
nclude, that however consistent the world may
 be,allowing certain suppositions and conject
ures, with the idea of such aDeity, it can ne
ver afford us an inference concerning his exi
stence. Theconsistence is not absolutely deni
ed, only the inference. Conjectures,especiall
y where infinity is excluded from the Divine 
attributes, mayperhaps be sufficient to prove
 a consistence, but can never befoundations f
or any inference.There seem to be four circum
stances, on which depend all, or the greatest
part of the ills, that molest sensible creatu
res; and it is notimpossible but all these ci
rcumstances may be necessary and unavoidable.
We know so little beyond common life, or even
 of common life, that, withregard to the econ
omy of a universe, there is no conjecture, ho
weverwild, which may not be just; nor any one
, however plausible, which maynot be erroneou
s. All that belongs to human understanding, i
n this deepignorance and obscurity, is to be 
sceptical, or at least cautious, andnot to ad
mit of any hypothesis whatever, much less of 
any which issupported by no appearance of pro
bability. Now, this I assert to be thecase wi
th regard to all the causes of evil, and the 
circumstances onwhich it depends. None of the
m appear to human reason in the least degreen
ecessary or unavoidable; nor can we suppose t
hem such, without theutmost license of imagin
ation.The first circumstance which introduces
 evil, is that contrivance oreconomy of the a
nimal creation, by which pains, as well as pl
easures, areemployed to excite all creatures 
to action, and make them vigilant in thegreat
 work of self-preservation. Now pleasure alon
e, in its variousdegrees, seems to human unde
rstanding sufficient for this purpose. Allani
mals might be constantly in a state of enjoym
ent: but when urged byany of the necessities 
of nature, such as thirst, hunger, weariness;
instead of pain, they might feel a diminution
 of pleasure, by which theymight be prompted 
to seek that object which is necessary to the
irsubsistence. Men pursue pleasure as eagerly
 as they avoid pain; at leastthey might have 
been so constituted. It seems, therefore, pla
inlypossible to carry on the business of life
 without any pain. Why then isany animal ever
 rendered susceptible of such a sensation? If
 animals canbe free from it an hour, they mig
ht enjoy a perpetual exemption from it;and it
 required as particular a contrivance of thei
r organs to producethat feeling, as to endow 
them with sight, hearing, or any of the sense
s.Shall we conjecture, that such a contrivanc
e was necessary, without anyappearance of rea
son? and shall we build on that conjecture as
 on themost certain truth?But a capacity of p
ain would not alone produce pain, were it not
 for thesecond circumstance, viz. the conduct
ing of the world by general laws;and this see
ms nowise necessary to a very perfect Being. 
It is true, ifeverything were conducted by pa
rticular volitions, the course of naturewould
 be perpetually broken, and no man could empl
oy his reason in theconduct of life. But migh
t not other particular volitions remedy thisi
nconvenience? In short, might not the Deity e
xterminate all ill,wherever it were to be fou
nd; and produce all good, without anypreparat
ion, or long progress of causes and effects?B
esides, we must consider, that, according to 
the present economy of theworld, the course o
f nature, though supposed exactly regular, ye
t to usappears not so, and many events are un
certain, and many disappoint ourexpectations.
 Health and sickness, calm and tempest, with 
an infinitenumber of other accidents, whose c
auses are unknown and variable, have agreat i
nfluence both on the fortunes of particular p
ersons and on theprosperity of public societi
es; and indeed all human life, in a manner,de
pends on such accidents. A being, therefore, 
who knows the secretsprings of the universe, 
might easily, by particular volitions, turn a
llthese accidents to the good of mankind, and
 render the whole world happy,without discove
ring himself in any operation. A fleet, whose
 purposeswere salutary to society, might alwa
ys meet with a fair wind. Goodprinces enjoy s
ound health and long life. Persons born to po
wer andauthority, be framed with good tempers
 and virtuous dispositions. A fewsuch events 
as these, regularly and wisely conducted, wou
ld change theface of the world; and yet would
 no more seem to disturb the course ofnature,
 or confound human conduct, than the present 
economy of things,where the causes are secret
, and variable, and compounded. Some smalltou
ches given to CALIGULA's brain in his infancy
, might have convertedhim into a TRAJAN. One 
wave, a little higher than the rest, by buryi
ngCAESAR and his fortune in the bottom of the
 ocean, might have restoredliberty to a consi
derable part of mankind. There may, for aught
 we know,be good reasons why Providence inter
poses not in this manner; but theyare unknown
 to us; and though the mere supposition, that
 such reasonsexist, may be sufficient to save
 the conclusion concerning the Divineattribut
es, yet surely it can never be sufficient to 
establish thatconclusion.If every thing in th
e universe be conducted by general laws, and 
ifanimals be rendered susceptible of pain, it
 scarcely seems possible butsome ill must ari
se in the various shocks of matter, and the v
ariousconcurrence and opposition of general l
aws; but this ill would be veryrare, were it 
not for the third circumstance, which I propo
sed tomention, viz. the great frugality with 
which all powers and faculties aredistributed
 to every particular being. So well adjusted 
are the organsand capacities of all animals, 
and so well fitted to their preservation,that
, as far as history or tradition reaches, the
re appears not to be anysingle species which 
has yet been extinguished in the universe. Ev
eryanimal has the requisite endowments; but t
hese endowments are bestowedwith so scrupulou
s an economy, that any considerable diminutio
n mustentirely destroy the creature. Wherever
 one power is increased, there isa proportion
al abatement in the others. Animals which exc
el in swiftnessare commonly defective in forc
e. Those which possess both are eitherimperfe
ct in some of their senses, or are oppressed 
with the most cravingwants. The human species
, whose chief excellency is reason and sagaci
ty,is of all others the most necessitous, and
 the most deficient in bodilyadvantages; with
out clothes, without arms, without food, with
out lodging,without any convenience of life, 
except what they owe to their own skilland in
dustry. In short, nature seems to have formed
 an exact calculationof the necessities of he
r creatures; and, like a rigid master, hasaff
orded them little more powers or endowments t
han what are strictlysufficient to supply tho
se necessities. An indulgent parent would hav
ebestowed a large stock, in order to guard ag
ainst accidents, and securethe happiness and 
welfare of the creature in the most unfortuna
teconcurrence of circumstances. Every course 
of life would not have been sosurrounded with
 precipices, that the least departure from th
e true path,by mistake or necessity, must inv
olve us in misery and ruin. Somereserve, some
 fund, would have been provided to ensure hap
piness; norwould the powers and the necessiti
es have been adjusted with so rigid aneconomy
. The Author of Nature is inconceivably power
ful: his force issupposed great, if not altog
ether inexhaustible: nor is there any reason,
as far as we can judge, to make him observe t
his strict frugality in hisdealings with his 
creatures. It would have been better, were hi
s powerextremely limited, to have created few
er animals, and to have endowedthese with mor
e faculties for their happiness and preservat
ion. A builderis never esteemed prudent, who 
undertakes a plan beyond what his stockwill e
nable him to finish.In order to cure most of 
the ills of human life, I require not that ma
nshould have the wings of the eagle, the swif
tness of the stag, the forceof the ox, the ar
ms of the lion, the scales of the crocodile o
rrhinoceros; much less do I demand the sagaci
ty of an angel or cherubim. Iam contented to 
take an increase in one single power or facul
ty of hissoul. Let him be endowed with a grea
ter propensity to industry andlabour; a more 
vigorous spring and activity of mind; a more 
constant bentto business and application. Let
 the whole species possess naturally anequal 
diligence with that which many individuals ar
e able to attain byhabit and reflection; and 
the most beneficial consequences, without any
allay of ill, is the immediate and necessary 
result of this endowment.Almost all the moral
, as well as natural evils of human life, ari
se fromidleness; and were our species, by the
 original constitution of theirframe, exempt 
from this vice or infirmity, the perfect cult
ivation ofland, the improvement of arts and m
anufactures, the exact execution ofevery offi
ce and duty, immediately follow; and men at o
nce may fullyreach that state of society, whi
ch is so imperfectly attained by the bestregu
lated government. But as industry is a power,
 and the most valuableof any, Nature seems de
termined, suitably to her usual maxims, to be
stowit on men with a very sparing hand; and r
ather to punish him severely forhis deficienc
y in it, than to reward him for his attainmen
ts. She has socontrived his frame, that nothi
ng but the most violent necessity canoblige h
im to labour; and she employs all his other w
ants to overcome, atleast in part, the want o
f diligence, and to endow him with some share
 ofa faculty of which she has thought fit nat
urally to bereave him. Here ourdemands may be
 allowed very humble, and therefore the more 
reasonable. Ifwe required the endowments of s
uperior penetration and judgement, of amore d
elicate taste of beauty, of a nicer sensibili
ty to benevolence andfriendship; we might be 
told, that we impiously pretend to break theo
rder of Nature; that we want to exalt ourselv
es into a higher rank ofbeing; that the prese
nts which we require, not being suitable to o
urstate and condition, would only be pernicio
us to us. But it is hard; Idare to repeat it,
 it is hard, that being placed in a world so 
full ofwants and necessities, where almost ev
ery being and element is either ourfoe or ref
uses its assistance ... we should also have o
ur own temper tostruggle with, and should be 
deprived of that faculty which can alonefence
 against these multiplied evils.The fourth ci
rcumstance, whence arises the misery and ill 
of theuniverse, is the inaccurate workmanship
 of all the springs and principlesof the grea
t machine of nature. It must be acknowledged,
 that there arefew parts of the universe, whi
ch seem not to serve some purpose, andwhose r
emoval would not produce a visible defect and
 disorder in thewhole. The parts hang all tog
ether; nor can one be touched withoutaffectin
g the rest, in a greater or less degree. But 
at the same time, itmust be observed, that no
ne of these parts or principles, however usef
ul,are so accurately adjusted, as to keep pre
cisely within those bounds inwhich their util
ity consists; but they are, all of them, apt,
 on everyoccasion, to run into the one extrem
e or the other. One would imagine,that this g
rand production had not received the last han
d of the maker;so little finished is every pa
rt, and so coarse are the strokes withwhich i
t is executed. Thus, the winds are requisite 
to convey the vapoursalong the surface of the
 globe, and to assist men in navigation: but 
howoft, rising up to tempests and hurricanes,
 do they become pernicious?Rains are necessar
y to nourish all the plants and animals of th
e earth:but how often are they defective? how
 often excessive? Heat is requisiteto all lif
e and vegetation; but is not always found in 
the dueproportion. On the mixture and secreti
on of the humours and juices of thebody depen
d the health and prosperity of the animal: bu
t the partsperform not regularly their proper
 function. What more useful than allthe passi
ons of the mind, ambition, vanity, love, ange
r? But how oft dothey break their bounds, and
 cause the greatest convulsions in society?Th
ere is nothing so advantageous in the univers
e, but what frequentlybecomes pernicious, by 
its excess or defect; nor has Nature guarded,
 withthe requisite accuracy, against all diso
rder or confusion. Theirregularity is never p
erhaps so great as to destroy any species; bu
t isoften sufficient to involve the individua
ls in ruin and misery.On the concurrence, the
n, of these four circumstances, does all or t
hegreatest part of natural evil depend. Were 
all living creatures incapableof pain, or wer
e the world administered by particular voliti
ons, evilnever could have found access into t
he universe: and were animals endowedwith a l
arge stock of powers and faculties, beyond wh
at strict necessityrequires; or were the seve
ral springs and principles of the universe so
accurately framed as to preserve always the j
ust temperament and medium;there must have be
en very little ill in comparison of what we f
eel atpresent. What then shall we pronounce o
n this occasion? Shall we say thatthese circu
mstances are not necessary, and that they mig
ht easily havebeen altered in the contrivance
 of the universe? This decision seems toopres
umptuous for creatures so blind and ignorant.
 Let us be more modestin our conclusions. Let
 us allow, that, if the goodness of the Deity
 (Imean a goodness like the human) could be e
stablished on any tolerablereasons a priori, 
these phenomena, however untoward, would not 
besufficient to subvert that principle; but m
ight easily, in some unknownmanner, be reconc
ilable to it. But let us still assert, that a
s thisgoodness is not antecedently establishe
d, but must be inferred from thephenomena, th
ere can be no grounds for such an inference, 
while there areso many ills in the universe, 
and while these ills might so easily havebeen
 remedied, as far as human understanding can 
be allowed to judge onsuch a subject. I am Sc
eptic enough to allow, that the bad appearanc
es,notwithstanding all my reasonings, may be 
compatible with such attributesas you suppose
; but surely they can never prove these attri
butes. Such aconclusion cannot result from Sc
epticism, but must arise from thephenomena, a
nd from our confidence in the reasonings whic
h we deduce fromthese phenomena.Look round th
is universe. What an immense profusion of bei
ngs, animatedand organised, sensible and acti
ve! You admire this prodigious varietyand fec
undity. But inspect a little more narrowly th
ese livingexistences, the only beings worth r
egarding. How hostile and destructiveto each 
other! How insufficient all of them for their
 own happiness! Howcontemptible or odious to 
the spectator! The whole presents nothing but
the idea of a blind Nature, impregnated by a 
great vivifying principle,and pouring forth f
rom her lap, without discernment or parental 
care, hermaimed and abortive children!Here th
e MANICHAEAN system occurs as a proper hypoth
esis to solve thedifficulty: and no doubt, in
 some respects, it is very specious, and hasm
ore probability than the common hypothesis, b
y giving a plausibleaccount of the strange mi
xture of good and ill which appears in life. 
Butif we consider, on the other hand, the per
fect uniformity and agreementof the parts of 
the universe, we shall not discover in it any
 marks ofthe combat of a malevolent with a be
nevolent being. There is indeed anopposition 
of pains and pleasures in the feelings of sen
sible creatures:but are not all the operation
s of Nature carried on by an opposition ofpri
nciples, of hot and cold, moist and dry, ligh
t and heavy? The trueconclusion is, that the 
original Source of all things is entirelyindi
fferent to all these principles; and has no m
ore regard to good aboveill, than to heat abo
ve cold, or to drought above moisture, or to 
lightabove heavy.There may four hypotheses be
 framed concerning the first causes of theuni
verse: that they are endowed with perfect goo
dness; that they haveperfect malice; that the
y are opposite, and have both goodness andmal
ice; that they have neither goodness nor mali
ce. Mixed phenomena cannever prove the two fo
rmer unmixed principles; and the uniformity a
ndsteadiness of general laws seem to oppose t
he third. The fourth,therefore, seems by far 
the most probable.What I have said concerning
 natural evil will apply to moral, with littl
eor no variation; and we have no more reason 
to infer, that the rectitudeof the Supreme Be
ing resembles human rectitude, than that his 
benevolenceresembles the human. Nay, it will 
be thought, that we have still greatercause t
o exclude from him moral sentiments, such as 
we feel them; sincemoral evil, in the opinion
 of many, is much more predominant above mora
lgood than natural evil above natural good.Bu
t even though this should not be allowed, and
 though the virtue whichis in mankind should 
be acknowledged much superior to the vice, ye
t solong as there is any vice at all in the u
niverse, it will very muchpuzzle you Anthropo
morphites, how to account for it. You must as
sign acause for it, without having recourse t
o the first cause. But as everyeffect must ha
ve a cause, and that cause another, you must 
either carryon the progression in infinitum, 
or rest on that original principle, whois the
 ultimate cause of all things...Hold! hold! c
ried DEMEA: Whither does your imagination hur
ry you? Ijoined in alliance with you, in orde
r to prove the incomprehensiblenature of the 
Divine Being, and refute the principles of CL
EANTHES, whowould measure every thing by huma
n rule and standard. But I now find yourunnin
g into all the topics of the greatest liberti
nes and infidels, andbetraying that holy caus
e which you seemingly espoused. Are you secre
tly,then, a more dangerous enemy than CLEANTH
ES himself?And are you so late in perceiving 
it? replied CLEANTHES. Believe me,DEMEA, your
 friend PHILO, from the beginning, has been a
musing himself atboth our expense; and it mus
t be confessed, that the injudiciousreasoning
 of our vulgar theology has given him but too
 just a handle ofridicule. The total infirmit
y of human reason, the absoluteincomprehensib
ility of the Divine Nature, the great and uni
versal misery,and still greater wickedness of
 men; these are strange topics, surely, tobe 
so fondly cherished by orthodox divines and d
octors. In ages ofstupidity and ignorance, in
deed, these principles may safely be espoused
;and perhaps no views of things are more prop
er to promote superstition,than such as encou
rage the blind amazement, the diffidence, and
melancholy of mankind. But at present...Blame
 not so much, interposed PHILO, the ignorance
 of these reverendgentlemen. They know how to
 change their style with the times. Formerlyi
t was a most popular theological topic to mai
ntain, that human life wasvanity and misery, 
and to exaggerate all the ills and pains whic
h areincident to men. But of late years, divi
nes, we find, begin to retractthis position; 
and maintain, though still with some hesitati
on, thatthere are more goods than evils, more
 pleasures than pains, even in thislife. When
 religion stood entirely upon temper and educ
ation, it wasthought proper to encourage mela
ncholy; as indeed mankind never haverecourse 
to superior powers so readily as in that disp
osition. But as menhave now learned to form p
rinciples, and to draw consequences, it isnec
essary to change the batteries, and to make u
se of such arguments aswill endure at least s
ome scrutiny and examination. This variation 
is thesame (and from the same causes) with th
at which I formerly remarked withregard to Sc
epticism.Thus PHILO continued to the last his
 spirit of opposition, and his censureof esta
blished opinions. But I could observe that DE
MEA did not at allrelish the latter part of t
he discourse; and he took occasion soon after
,on some pretence or other, to leave the comp
any.PART 12After DEMEA's departure, CLEANTHES
 and PHILO continued the conversationin the f
ollowing manner. Our friend, I am afraid, sai
d CLEANTHES, willhave little inclination to r
evive this topic of discourse, while you arei
n company; and to tell truth, PHILO, I should
 rather wish to reason witheither of you apar
t on a subject so sublime and interesting. Yo
ur spiritof controversy, joined to your abhor
rence of vulgar superstition, carriesyou stra
nge lengths, when engaged in an argument; and
 there is nothing sosacred and venerable, eve
n in your own eyes, which you spare on thatoc
casion.I must confess, replied PHILO, that I 
am less cautious on the subject ofNatural Rel
igion than on any other; both because I know 
that I can never,on that head, corrupt the pr
inciples of any man of common sense; andbecau
se no one, I am confident, in whose eyes I ap
pear a man of commonsense, will ever mistake 
my intentions. You, in particular, CLEANTHES,
with whom I live in unreserved intimacy; you 
are sensible, thatnotwithstanding the freedom
 of my conversation, and my love of singulara
rguments, no one has a deeper sense of religi
on impressed on his mind,or pays more profoun
d adoration to the Divine Being, as he discov
ershimself to reason, in the inexplicable con
trivance and artifice ofnature. A purpose, an
 intention, a design, strikes every where the
 mostcareless, the most stupid thinker; and n
o man can be so hardened inabsurd systems, as
 at all times to reject it. That Nature does 
nothing invain, is a maxim established in all
 the schools, merely from thecontemplation of
 the works of Nature, without any religious p
urpose; and,from a firm conviction of its tru
th, an anatomist, who had observed a neworgan
 or canal, would never be satisfied till he h
ad also discovered itsuse and intention. One 
great foundation of the Copernican system is 
themaxim, That Nature acts by the simplest me
thods, and chooses the mostproper means to an
y end; and astronomers often, without thinkin
g of it,lay this strong foundation of piety a
nd religion. The same thing isobservable in o
ther parts of philosophy: And thus all the sc
iences almostlead us insensibly to acknowledg
e a first intelligent Author; and theirauthor
ity is often so much the greater, as they do 
not directly professthat intention.It is with
 pleasure I hear GALEN reason concerning the 
structure of thehuman body. The anatomy of a 
man, says he [De formatione foetus], discover
sabove 600 different muscles; and whoever dul
y considers these, will find,that, in each of
 them, Nature must have adjusted at least ten
 differentcircumstances, in order to attain t
he end which she proposed; properfigure, just
 magnitude, right disposition of the several 
ends, upper andlower position of the whole, t
he due insertion of the several nerves,veins,
 and arteries: So that, in the muscles alone,
 above 6000 severalviews and intentions must 
have been formed and executed. The bones heca
lculates to be 284: The distinct purposes aim
ed at in the structure ofeach, above forty. W
hat a prodigious display of artifice, even in
 thesesimple and homogeneous parts! But if we
 consider the skin, ligaments,vessels, glandu
les, humours, the several limbs and members o
f the body;how must our astonishment rise upo
n us, in proportion to the number andintricac
y of the parts so artificially adjusted! The 
further we advancein these researches, we dis
cover new scenes of art and wisdom: But descr
ystill, at a distance, further scenes beyond 
our reach; in the fineinternal structure of t
he parts, in the economy of the brain, in the
fabric of the seminal vessels. All these arti
fices are repeated in everydifferent species 
of animal, with wonderful variety, and with e
xactpropriety, suited to the different intent
ions of Nature in framing eachspecies. And if
 the infidelity of GALEN, even when these nat
ural scienceswere still imperfect, could not 
withstand such striking appearances, towhat p
itch of pertinacious obstinacy must a philoso
pher in this age haveattained, who can now do
ubt of a Supreme Intelligence!Could I meet wi
th one of this species (who, I thank God, are
 very rare),I would ask him: Supposing there 
were a God, who did not discover himselfimmed
iately to our senses, were it possible for hi
m to give strongerproofs of his existence, th
an what appear on the whole face of Nature?Wh
at indeed could such a Divine Being do, but c
opy the present economy ofthings; render many
 of his artifices so plain, that no stupidity
 couldmistake them; afford glimpses of still 
greater artifices, whichdemonstrate his prodi
gious superiority above our narrow apprehensi
ons;and conceal altogether a great many from 
such imperfect creatures? Now,according to al
l rules of just reasoning, every fact must pa
ss forundisputed, when it is supported by all
 the arguments which its natureadmits of; eve
n though these arguments be not, in themselve
s, verynumerous or forcible: How much more, i
n the present case, where no humanimagination
 can compute their number, and no understandi
ng estimate theircogency!I shall further add,
 said CLEANTHES, to what you have so well urg
ed, thatone great advantage of the principle 
of Theism, is, that it is the onlysystem of c
osmogony which can be rendered intelligible a
nd complete, andyet can throughout preserve a
 strong analogy to what we every day see ande
xperience in the world. The comparison of the
 universe to a machine ofhuman contrivance, i
s so obvious and natural, and is justified by
 so manyinstances of order and design in Natu
re, that it must immediately strikeall unprej
udiced apprehensions, and procure universal a
pprobation.Whoever attempts to weaken this th
eory, cannot pretend to succeed byestablishin
g in its place any other that is precise and 
determinate: Itis sufficient for him if he st
art doubts and difficulties; and by remoteand
 abstract views of things, reach that suspens
e of judgement, which ishere the utmost bound
ary of his wishes. But, besides that this sta
te ofmind is in itself unsatisfactory, it can
 never be steadily maintainedagainst such str
iking appearances as continually engage us in
to thereligious hypothesis. A false, absurd s
ystem, human nature, from theforce of prejudi
ce, is capable of adhering to with obstinacy 
andperseverance: But no system at all, in opp
osition to a theory supportedby strong and ob
vious reason, by natural propensity, and by e
arlyeducation, I think it absolutely impossib
le to maintain or defend.So little, replied P
HILO, do I esteem this suspense of judgement 
in thepresent case to be possible, that I am 
apt to suspect there enterssomewhat of a disp
ute of words into this controversy, more than
 isusually imagined. That the works of Nature
 bear a great analogy to theproductions of ar
t, is evident; and according to all the rules
 of goodreasoning, we ought to infer, if we a
rgue at all concerning them, thattheir causes
 have a proportional analogy. But as there ar
e alsoconsiderable differences, we have reaso
n to suppose a proportionaldifference in the 
causes; and in particular, ought to attribute
 a muchhigher degree of power and energy to t
he supreme cause, than any we haveever observ
ed in mankind. Here then the existence of a D
EITY is plainlyascertained by reason: and if 
we make it a question, whether, on accountof 
these analogies, we can properly call him a m
ind or intelligence,notwithstanding the vast 
difference which may reasonably be supposedbe
tween him and human minds; what is this but a
 mere verbal controversy?No man can deny the 
analogies between the effects: To restrain ou
rselvesfrom inquiring concerning the causes i
s scarcely possible. From thisinquiry, the le
gitimate conclusion is, that the causes have 
also ananalogy: And if we are not contented w
ith calling the first and supremecause a GOD 
or DEITY, but desire to vary the expression; 
what can we callhim but MIND or THOUGHT, to w
hich he is justly supposed to bear aconsidera
ble resemblance?All men of sound reason are d
isgusted with verbal disputes, which aboundso
 much in philosophical and theological inquir
ies; and it is found, thatthe only remedy for
 this abuse must arise from clear definitions
, fromthe precision of those ideas which ente
r into any argument, and from thestrict and u
niform use of those terms which are employed.
 But there is aspecies of controversy, which,
 from the very nature of language and ofhuman
 ideas, is involved in perpetual ambiguity, a
nd can never, by anyprecaution or any definit
ions, be able to reach a reasonable certainty
 orprecision. These are the controversies con
cerning the degrees of anyquality or circumst
ance. Men may argue to all eternity, whether 
HANNIBALbe a great, or a very great, or a sup
erlatively great man, what degree ofbeauty CL
EOPATRA possessed, what epithet of praise LIV
Y or THUCYDIDES isentitled to, without bringi
ng the controversy to any determination. Thed
isputants may here agree in their sense, and 
differ in the terms, orvice versa; yet never 
be able to define their terms, so as to enter
 intoeach other's meaning: Because the degree
s of these qualities are not,like quantity or
 number, susceptible of any exact mensuration
, whichmay be the standard in the controversy
. That the dispute concerningTheism is of thi
s nature, and consequently is merely verbal, 
or perhaps,if possible, still more incurably 
ambiguous, will appear upon theslightest inqu
iry. I ask the Theist, if he does not allow, 
that there isa great and immeasurable, becaus
e incomprehensible difference between thehuma
n and the divine mind: The more pious he is, 
the more readily will heassent to the affirma
tive, and the more will he be disposed to mag
nifythe difference: He will even assert, that
 the difference is of a naturewhich cannot be
 too much magnified. I next turn to the Athei
st, who, Iassert, is only nominally so, and c
an never possibly be in earnest; and Iask him
, whether, from the coherence and apparent sy
mpathy in all theparts of this world, there b
e not a certain degree of analogy among allth
e operations of Nature, in every situation an
d in every age; whetherthe rotting of a turni
p, the generation of an animal, and the struc
tureof human thought, be not energies that pr
obably bear some remote analogyto each other:
 It is impossible he can deny it: He will rea
dilyacknowledge it. Having obtained this conc
ession, I push him still furtherin his retrea
t; and I ask him, if it be not probable, that
 the principlewhich first arranged, and still
 maintains order in this universe, bearsnot a
lso some remote inconceivable analogy to the 
other operations ofnature, and, among the res
t, to the economy of human mind and thought.H
owever reluctant, he must give his assent. Wh
ere then, cry I to boththese antagonists, is 
the subject of your dispute? The Theist allow
s,that the original intelligence is very diff
erent from human reason: TheAtheist allows, t
hat the original principle of order bears som
e remoteanalogy to it. Will you quarrel, Gent
lemen, about the degrees, and enterinto a con
troversy, which admits not of any precise mea
ning, norconsequently of any determination? I
f you should be so obstinate, Ishould not be 
surprised to find you insensibly change sides
; while theTheist, on the one hand, exaggerat
es the dissimilarity between theSupreme Being
, and frail, imperfect, variable, fleeting, a
nd mortalcreatures; and the Atheist, on the o
ther, magnifies the analogy among allthe oper
ations of Nature, in every period, every situ
ation, and everyposition. Consider then, wher
e the real point of controversy lies; and ify
ou cannot lay aside your disputes, endeavour,
 at least, to cureyourselves of your animosit
y.And here I must also acknowledge, CLEANTHES
, that as the works of Naturehave a much grea
ter analogy to the effects of our art and con
trivance,than to those of our benevolence and
 justice, we have reason to infer,that the na
tural attributes of the Deity have a greater 
resemblance tothose of men, than his moral ha
ve to human virtues. But what is theconsequen
ce? Nothing but this, that the moral qualitie
s of man are moredefective in their kind than
 his natural abilities. For, as the SupremeBe
ing is allowed to be absolutely and entirely 
perfect, whatever differsmost from him, depar
ts the furthest from the supreme standard ofr
ectitude and perfection.It seems evident that
 the dispute between the Skeptics and Dogmati
stsis entirely verbal, or at least regards on
ly the degrees of doubt andassurance which we
 ought to indulge with regard to all reasonin
g; and suchdisputes are commonly, at the bott
om, verbal, and admit not of any precisedeter
mination. No philosophical Dogmatist denies t
hat there aredifficulties both with regard to
 the senses and to all science, and thatthese
 difficulties are in a regular, logical metho
d, absolutelyinsolvable. No Skeptic denies th
at we lie under an absolute necessity,notwith
standing these difficulties, of thinking, and
 believing, andreasoning, with regard to all 
kinds of subjects, and even of frequentlyasse
nting with confidence and security. The only 
difference, then, betweenthese sects, if they
 merit that name, is, that the Sceptic, from 
habit,caprice, or inclination, insists most o
n the difficulties; the Dogmatist,for like re
asons, on the necessity.These, CLEANTHES, are
 my unfeigned sentiments on this subject; and
 thesesentiments, you know, I have ever cheri
shed and maintained. But inproportion to my v
eneration for true religion, is my abhorrence
 of vulgarsuperstitions; and I indulge a pecu
liar pleasure, I confess, in pushingsuch prin
ciples, sometimes into absurdity, sometimes i
nto impiety. Andyou are sensible, that all bi
gots, notwithstanding their great aversionto 
the latter above the former, are commonly equ
ally guilty of both.My inclination, replied C
LEANTHES, lies, I own, a contrary way. Religi
on,however corrupted, is still better than no
 religion at all. The doctrineof a future sta
te is so strong and necessary a security to m
orals, thatwe never ought to abandon or negle
ct it. For if finite and temporaryrewards and
 punishments have so great an effect, as we d
aily find; howmuch greater must be expected f
rom such as are infinite and eternal?How happ
ens it then, said PHILO, if vulgar superstiti
on be so salutary tosociety, that all history
 abounds so much with accounts of its pernici
ousconsequences on public affairs? Factions, 
civil wars, persecutions,subversions of gover
nment, oppression, slavery; these are the dis
malconsequences which always attend its preva
lency over the minds of men. Ifthe religious 
spirit be ever mentioned in any historical na
rration, weare sure to meet afterwards with a
 detail of the miseries which attendit. And n
o period of time can be happier or more prosp
erous, than thosein which it is never regarde
d or heard of.The reason of this observation,
 replied CLEANTHES, is obvious. The properoff
ice of religion is to regulate the heart of m
en, humanise theirconduct, infuse the spirit 
of temperance, order, and obedience; and asit
s operation is silent, and only enforces the 
motives of morality andjustice, it is in dang
er of being overlooked, and confounded with t
heseother motives. When it distinguishes itse
lf, and acts as a separateprinciple over men,
 it has departed from its proper sphere, and 
hasbecome only a cover to faction and ambitio
n.And so will all religion, said PHILO, excep
t the philosophical andrational kind. Your re
asonings are more easily eluded than my facts
. Theinference is not just, because finite an
d temporary rewards andpunishments have so gr
eat influence, that therefore such as are inf
initeand eternal must have so much greater. C
onsider, I beseech you, theattachment which w
e have to present things, and the little conc
ern whichwe discover for objects so remote an
d uncertain. When divines aredeclaiming again
st the common behaviour and conduct of the wo
rld, theyalways represent this principle as t
he strongest imaginable (which indeedit is); 
and describe almost all human kind as lying u
nder the influenceof it, and sunk into the de
epest lethargy and unconcern about theirrelig
ious interests. Yet these same divines, when 
they refute theirspeculative antagonists, sup
pose the motives of religion to be sopowerful
, that, without them, it were impossible for 
civil society tosubsist; nor are they ashamed
 of so palpable a contradiction. It iscertain
, from experience, that the smallest grain of
 natural honesty andbenevolence has more effe
ct on men's conduct, than the most pompous vi
ewssuggested by theological theories and syst
ems. A man's naturalinclination works incessa
ntly upon him; it is for ever present to them
ind, and mingles itself with every view and c
onsideration: whereasreligious motives, where
 they act at all, operate only by starts andb
ounds; and it is scarcely possible for them t
o become altogetherhabitual to the mind. The 
force of the greatest gravity, say thephiloso
phers, is infinitely small, in comparison of 
that of the leastimpulse: yet it is certain, 
that the smallest gravity will, in the end,pr
evail above a great impulse; because no strok
es or blows can berepeated with such constanc
y as attraction and gravitation.Another advan
tage of inclination: It engages on its side a
ll the wit andingenuity of the mind; and when
 set in opposition to religiousprinciples, se
eks every method and art of eluding them: In 
which it isalmost always successful. Who can 
explain the heart of man, or accountfor those
 strange salvos and excuses, with which peopl
e satisfythemselves, when they follow their i
nclinations in opposition to theirreligious d
uty? This is well understood in the world; an
d none but foolsever repose less trust in a m
an, because they hear, that from study andphi
losophy, he has entertained some speculative 
doubts with regard totheological subjects. An
d when we have to do with a man, who makes ag
reat profession of religion and devotion, has
 this any other effect uponseveral, who pass 
for prudent, than to put them on their guard,
 lest theybe cheated and deceived by him?We m
ust further consider, that philosophers, who 
cultivate reason andreflection, stand less in
 need of such motives to keep them under ther
estraint of morals; and that the vulgar, who 
alone may need them, areutterly incapable of 
so pure a religion as represents the Deity to
 bepleased with nothing but virtue in human b
ehaviour. The recommendationsto the Divinity 
are generally supposed to be either frivolous
observances, or rapturous ecstasies, or a big
oted credulity. We need notrun back into anti
quity, or wander into remote regions, to find
 instancesof this degeneracy. Amongst ourselv
es, some have been guilty of thatatrociousnes
s, unknown to the Egyptian and Grecian supers
titions, ofdeclaiming in express terms, again
st morality; and representing it as asure for
feiture of the Divine favour, if the least tr
ust or reliance belaid upon it.But even thoug
h superstition or enthusiasm should not put i
tself indirect opposition to morality; the ve
ry diverting of the attention, theraising up 
a new and frivolous species of merit, the pre
posterousdistribution which it makes of prais
e and blame, must have the mostpernicious con
sequences, and weaken extremely men's attachm
ent to thenatural motives of justice and huma
nity.Such a principle of action likewise, not
 being any of the familiarmotives of human co
nduct, acts only by intervals on the temper; 
and mustbe roused by continual efforts, in or
der to render the pious zealotsatisfied with 
his own conduct, and make him fulfil his devo
tional task.Many religious exercises are ente
red into with seeming fervour, where theheart
, at the time, feels cold and languid: A habi
t of dissimulation isby degrees contracted; a
nd fraud and falsehood become the predominant
principle. Hence the reason of that vulgar ob
servation, that the highestzeal in religion a
nd the deepest hypocrisy, so far from beingin
consistent, are often or commonly united in t
he same individualcharacter.The bad effects o
f such habits, even in common life, are easil
y imagined;but where the interests of religio
n are concerned, no morality can beforcible e
nough to bind the enthusiastic zealot. The sa
credness of thecause sanctifies every measure
 which can be made use of to promote it.The s
teady attention alone to so important an inte
rest as that of eternalsalvation, is apt to e
xtinguish the benevolent affections, and bege
t anarrow, contracted selfishness. And when s
uch a temper is encouraged, iteasily eludes a
ll the general precepts of charity and benevo
lence.Thus, the motives of vulgar superstitio
n have no great influence ongeneral conduct; 
nor is their operation favourable to morality
, in theinstances where they predominate.Is t
here any maxim in politics more certain and i
nfallible, than thatboth the number and autho
rity of priests should be confined within ver
ynarrow limits; and that the civil magistrate
 ought, for ever, to keep hisfasces and axes 
from such dangerous hands? But if the spirit 
of popularreligion were so salutary to societ
y, a contrary maxim ought to prevail.The grea
ter number of priests, and their greater auth
ority and riches,will always augment the reli
gious spirit. And though the priests have the
guidance of this spirit, why may we not expec
t a superior sanctity oflife, and greater ben
evolence and moderation, from persons who are
 setapart for religion, who are continually i
nculcating it upon others, andwho must themse
lves imbibe a greater share of it? Whence com
es it then,that, in fact, the utmost a wise m
agistrate can propose with regard topopular r
eligions, is, as far as possible, to make a s
aving game of it,and to prevent their pernici
ous consequences with regard to society?Every
 expedient which he tries for so humble a pur
pose is surrounded withinconveniences. If he 
admits only one religion among his subjects, 
hemust sacrifice, to an uncertain prospect of
 tranquillity, everyconsideration of public l
iberty, science, reason, industry, and even h
isown independency. If he gives indulgence to
 several sects, which is thewiser maxim, he m
ust preserve a very philosophical indifferenc
e to all ofthem, and carefully restrain the p
retensions of the prevailing sect;otherwise h
e can expect nothing but endless disputes, qu
arrels, factions,persecutions, and civil comm
otions.True religion, I allow, has no such pe
rnicious consequences: but we musttreat of re
ligion, as it has commonly been found in the 
world; nor have Iany thing to do with that sp
eculative tenet of Theism, which, as it is as
pecies of philosophy, must partake of the ben
eficial influence of thatprinciple, and at th
e same time must lie under a like inconvenien
ce, ofbeing always confined to very few perso
ns.Oaths are requisite in all courts of judic
ature; but it is a questionwhether their auth
ority arises from any popular religion. It is
 thesolemnity and importance of the occasion,
 the regard to reputation, andthe reflecting 
on the general interests of society, which ar
e the chiefrestraints upon mankind. Custom-ho
use oaths and political oaths are butlittle r
egarded even by some who pretend to principle
s of honesty andreligion; and a Quaker's asse
veration is with us justly put upon the samef
ooting with the oath of any other person. I k
now, that POLYBIUS[Lib. vi. cap. 54.] ascribe
s the infamy of GREEK faith to the prevalency
 ofthe EPICUREAN philosophy: but I know also,
 that Punic faith had as bad areputation in a
ncient times as Irish evidence has in modern;
 though wecannot account for these vulgar obs
ervations by the same reason. Not tomention t
hat Greek faith was infamous before the rise 
of the Epicureanphilosophy; and EURIPIDES [Ip
higenia in Tauride], in a passage which Ishal
l point out to you, has glanced a remarkable 
stroke of satire againsthis nation, with rega
rd to this circumstance.Take care, PHILO, rep
lied CLEANTHES, take care: push not matters t
oo far:allow not your zeal against false reli
gion to undermine your venerationfor the true
. Forfeit not this principle, the chief, the 
only greatcomfort in life; and our principal 
support amidst all the attacks ofadverse fort
une. The most agreeable reflection, which it 
is possible forhuman imagination to suggest, 
is that of genuine Theism, which representsus
 as the workmanship of a Being perfectly good
, wise, and powerful; whocreated us for happi
ness; and who, having implanted in us immeasu
rabledesires of good, will prolong our existe
nce to all eternity, and willtransfer us into
 an infinite variety of scenes, in order to s
atisfy thosedesires, and render our felicity 
complete and durable. Next to such aBeing him
self (if the comparison be allowed), the happ
iest lot which wecan imagine, is that of bein
g under his guardianship and protection.These
 appearances, said PHILO, are most engaging a
nd alluring; and withregard to the true philo
sopher, they are more than appearances. But i
thappens here, as in the former case, that, w
ith regard to the greaterpart of mankind, the
 appearances are deceitful, and that the terr
ors ofreligion commonly prevail above its com
forts.It is allowed, that men never have reco
urse to devotion so readily aswhen dejected w
ith grief or depressed with sickness. Is not 
this a proof,that the religious spirit is not
 so nearly allied to joy as to sorrow?But men
, when afflicted, find consolation in religio
n, replied CLEANTHES.Sometimes, said PHILO: b
ut it is natural to imagine, that they will f
orma notion of those unknown beings, suitably
 to the present gloom andmelancholy of their 
temper, when they betake themselves to thecon
templation of them. Accordingly, we find the 
tremendous images topredominate in all religi
ons; and we ourselves, after having employed 
themost exalted expression in our description
s of the Deity, fall into theflattest contrad
iction in affirming that the damned are infin
itelysuperior in number to the elect.I shall 
venture to affirm, that there never was a pop
ular religion, whichrepresented the state of 
departed souls in such a light, as would rend
erit eligible for human kind that there shoul
d be such a state. These finemodels of religi
on are the mere product of philosophy. For as
 death liesbetween the eye and the prospect o
f futurity, that event is so shockingto Natur
e, that it must throw a gloom on all the regi
ons which lie beyondit; and suggest to the ge
nerality of mankind the idea of CERBERUS andF
URIES; devils, and torrents of fire and brims
tone.It is true, both fear and hope enter int
o religion; because both thesepassions, at di
fferent times, agitate the human mind, and ea
ch of themforms a species of divinity suitabl
e to itself. But when a man is in acheerful d
isposition, he is fit for business, or compan
y, orentertainment of any kind; and he natura
lly applies himself to these, andthinks not o
f religion. When melancholy and dejected, he 
has nothing todo but brood upon the terrors o
f the invisible world, and to plungehimself s
till deeper in affliction. It may indeed happ
en, that after hehas, in this manner, engrave
d the religious opinions deep into histhought
 and imagination, there may arrive a change o
f health orcircumstances, which may restore h
is good humour, and raising cheerfulprospects
 of futurity, make him run into the other ext
reme of joy andtriumph. But still it must be 
acknowledged, that, as terror is theprimary p
rinciple of religion, it is the passion which
 alwayspredominates in it, and admits but of 
short intervals of pleasure.Not to mention, t
hat these fits of excessive, enthusiastic joy
, byexhausting the spirits, always prepare th
e way for equal fits ofsuperstitious terror a
nd dejection; nor is there any state of mind 
sohappy as the calm and equable. But this sta
te it is impossible tosupport, where a man th
inks that he lies in such profound darkness a
nduncertainty, between an eternity of happine
ss and an eternity of misery.No wonder that s
uch an opinion disjoints the ordinary frame o
f the mind,and throws it into the utmost conf
usion. And though that opinion isseldom so st
eady in its operation as to influence all the
 actions; yet itis apt to make a considerable
 breach in the temper, and to produce thatglo
om and melancholy so remarkable in all devout
 people.It is contrary to common sense to ent
ertain apprehensions or terrors uponaccount o
f any opinion whatsoever, or to imagine that 
we run any riskhereafter, by the freest use o
f our reason. Such a sentiment implies bothan
 absurdity and an inconsistency. It is an abs
urdity to believe that theDeity has human pas
sions, and one of the lowest of human passion
s, arestless appetite for applause. It is an 
inconsistency to believe, that,since the Deit
y has this human passion, he has not others a
lso; and, inparticular, a disregard to the op
inions of creatures so much inferior.To know 
God, says SENECA, is to worship him. All othe
r worship is indeedabsurd, superstitious, and
 even impious. It degrades him to the lowcond
ition of mankind, who are delighted with entr
eaty, solicitation,presents, and flattery. Ye
t is this impiety the smallest of whichsupers
tition is guilty. Commonly, it depresses the 
Deity far below thecondition of mankind; and 
represents him as a capricious DEMON, whoexer
cises his power without reason and without hu
manity! And were thatDivine Being disposed to
 be offended at the vices and follies of sill
ymortals, who are his own workmanship, ill wo
uld it surely fare with thevotaries of most p
opular superstitions. Nor would any of human 
race merithis favour, but a very few, the phi
losophical Theists, who entertain, orrather i
ndeed endeavour to entertain, suitable notion
s of his Divineperfections: As the only perso
ns entitled to his compassion andindulgence w
ould be the philosophical Sceptics, a sect al
most equallyrare, who, from a natural diffide
nce of their own capacity, suspend, orendeavo
ur to suspend, all judgement with regard to s
uch sublime and suchextraordinary subjects.If
 the whole of Natural Theology, as some peopl
e seem to maintain,resolves itself into one s
imple, though somewhat ambiguous, at leastund
efined proposition, That the cause or causes 
of order in the universeprobably bear some re
mote analogy to human intelligence: If thispr
oposition be not capable of extension, variat
ion, or more particularexplication: If it aff
ords no inference that affects human life, or
 canbe the source of any action or forbearanc
e: And if the analogy, imperfectas it is, can
 be carried no further than to the human inte
lligence, andcannot be transferred, with any 
appearance of probability, to the otherqualit
ies of the mind; if this really be the case, 
what can the mostinquisitive, contemplative, 
and religious man do more than give a plain,p
hilosophical assent to the proposition, as of
ten as it occurs, andbelieve that the argumen
ts on which it is established exceed theobjec
tions which lie against it? Some astonishment
, indeed, willnaturally arise from the greatn
ess of the object; some melancholy fromits ob
scurity; some contempt of human reason, that 
it can give nosolution more satisfactory with
 regard to so extraordinary andmagnificent a 
question. But believe me, CLEANTHES, the most
 naturalsentiment which a well-disposed mind 
will feel on this occasion, is alonging desir
e and expectation that Heaven would be please
d to dissipate,at least alleviate, this profo
und ignorance, by affording some moreparticul
ar revelation to mankind, and making discover
ies of the nature,attributes, and operations 
of the Divine object of our faith. A person,s
easoned with a just sense of the imperfection
s of natural reason, willfly to revealed trut
h with the greatest avidity: While the haught
yDogmatist, persuaded that he can erect a com
plete system of Theology bythe mere help of p
hilosophy, disdains any further aid, and reje
cts thisadventitious instructor. To be a phil
osophical Sceptic is, in a man ofletters, the
 first and most essential step towards being 
a sound,believing Christian; a proposition wh
ich I would willingly recommend tothe attenti
on of PAMPHILUS: And I hope CLEANTHES will fo
rgive me forinterposing so far in the educati
on and instruction of his pupil.CLEANTHES and
 PHILO pursued not this conversation much fur
ther: and asnothing ever made greater impress
ion on me, than all the reasonings ofthat day
, so I confess, that, upon a serious review o
f the whole, Icannot but think, that PHILO's 
principles are more probable than DEMEA's;but
 that those of CLEANTHES approach still neare
r to the truth.End of the Project Gutenberg E
