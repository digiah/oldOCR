»m*—*i i -i ;Pamphilus to Hermippus.It has be
en remarked, my Hermip-pus, that though the a

truction in the form of dialogue, thismethod 
of composition has been littleA practised6 Di

d has seldomsucceeded in the hands of those w
hohave attempted it. Accurate and regular arg
ument, indeed, such as is nowexpected of phil
osophical inquirers, na-turally throws a man 
into the methodical and didactic manner ; whe
re he canimmediately, without preparation, ex
plain the point at which he aims; andthence p
roceed, without interruption,to deduce the pr
oofs on which it isestablished. To deliver a 
SYSTEM inconversation, scarcely appears natur
al ;and while the dialogue-writer desires,by 
departing from the direct style ofrcompositio
n, to give a freer air to hisperformance, and
 avoid the appearanceof Author and Reader, he
 is apt to runinto a worse inconvenience, and
 conveythe image of Pedagogue and Pupil. Orif

 of topics, and preserving a proper balance a

ften loses so much time inpreparations and tr

 himself compensated, by all the graces of di

hich are sacrificed to them.There are some su
bjects, however,to which dialogue-writing is 
peculiarlyadapted, and where it is still pref
erableto the direct and simple method of comp
osition.Any point of doctrine, which is sooln
nous that it scarcely admits of dispute, but 
at the same time so importantthat it cannot b
e too often inculcated,seems to require some 
such method ofhandling it; where the novelty 
of themanner may compensate the triteness oft

sion to observe,while I passed, as usual, par
t of the summer-season with CLEANTHES, andwas
 present at those, conversations ofhis with P
HILO and DEMEA. of whichI gave you lately som
e imperfect account. Your curiosity, you then
 toldme, was so excited, that I must of neces
sity enter into a more exact detail oftheir r
easonings, and display those various systems 
which they advanced withregard to so delicate
 a subject as that ofNatural Religion. The re
markable con-trast in their characters still 
farther raised your expectations ; while you 
opposed the accurate philosophical turn ofCle
anthes to the careless scepticismof Philo, or
 compared either of theirdispositions with th
e rigid inflexible orthodoxy of Demea. My you
th ren<-dered me a mere auditor of their dis-
:putes ;Natural Religion. iiputes ; and that 
curiosity natural to theearly season of life,
 has so deeply imprinted in my memory the who
le chainand connection of their arguments,tha
t, I hope, I shall not omit or confound any c
onsiderable part of them inthe recital.A 4 PA

y,whom PartI found sitting in Cleanthes's'^.l

 on the great care whichhe took of my educati
on, and on hisunwearied perseverance and cons
tancyin all his friendships. The father of.Pa
 mphilu s, said he, was yourintimatefriend: T

ded as your adopted son,were we to judge by t
he pains whichyou bestow in conveying to him 
everyuseful branch of literature and science.
-You are .no more wanting,. I am persuaded, .
 in prudence than in industry.I shall, theref
ore, communicate to you14 Dialogues concernin
gPart a maxim which I have observed withe-w-*
 regard to my own children, that I maylearn h
ow far it agrees with your practice. The meth
od I follow in their e-ducation is founded on
 the saying of anancient, " That students of 
philosophy** oughtfrst to learn Logics, then 
Ethics," next Physics, last of all the Nature
 of" the Gods *." This science of NaturalTheo
logy, according to him, being themost profoun
d and abstruse of any, required the maturest 
judgment in its students ; and none but a min
d, enrichedwith all the other sciences, can s
afely beentrusted with it.Are you so late, sa
ys PhiLO,"m teaching your children the princi
ples of religion? Is there no danger of their
 neglecting, or rejecting altogether, thoseop
inions, of which they have heard solittle dur
ing the whole course of theireducation ? It i
s only as a science, replied* Chryfippus apud
 Plut. de repug. Stoicorum,Natural Religion. 
• 15plied Demea, subjected to human rea- j Ts
oning and disputation, that I postpone ^^-jth
e study of Natural Theology. To season their 
minds with early piety, is mychief care ; and
 by continual preceptand instruction, and I h
ope too by example, I imprint deeply on their
 tenderminds an habitual reverence for all th
eprinciples of religion. While they passthrou
gh every other science, I still remark the un
certainty of each part ; theeternal disputati
ons of men ; the obscurity of all philosophy 
; and the strange,ridiculous conclusions, whi
ch some ofthe greatest geniuses have derived 
fromthe principles of mere human reason.Havin
g thus tamed their mind to a proper submissio
n and self-diffidence, Ihave no longer any sc
ruple of opening ..to them the greatest myste
ries of reli- .gion ; nor apprehend any dange
r fromthat assuming arrogance of philosophy,w
hich may lead them to reject the mostestablis
hed doctrines and opinions.Your16 Dialogues c
oncerningPart Your precaution, says Philo, of
sea-«^v>j soning your childrens minds early w
ithpiety, is certainly very reasonable ; andn
o more than is requisite in this profane and 
irreligious age. But what Ichiefly admire in 
your plan of education, is your method of dra
wing advantage from the very principles of ph
ilosophy and learning, which, by inspiring pr
ide and self-sufficiency, havecommonly, in al
l ages, been found sodestructive to the princ
iples of religion.The vulgar, indeed, we may 
remark,who are unacquainted with science andp
rofound inquiry, observing the end-less dispu
tes of the learned, have commonly a thorough 
contempt for Philo-losophy ; and rivet themse
lves the faster,by that means, in the great p
oints oftheology which have been taught them.

s will, I hope,agree with me, that, after we 
have a-bandoned ignorance, the surest remedy,
there is still one expedient left to prevent 
this profane liberty. LetDemea'sprinciples be
 improved and cultivated :Let us become thoro

 the very ideas of matter, causeand effect, e

 can we decide concern-cerning the origin of

 I could observe a smile in thecountenance bo

med toimply an unreserved satisfaction in the
doctrines delivered: But, in Clean-thes'sNatu

 faith on phi-1losophical scepticism; and you
 think,that if certainty or evidence be expel
ledfrom every other subject of inquiry, itwil
l all retire to these theological dod-trines,
 and there acquire a superior forceand author

and sincere as youpretend, we mall learn by a

hensee, whether you go out at the door orthe 
window; and whether you reallydoubt, if your 
body has gravity, or canbe injured by its fal

 our fallacious senses, and more fallacious e
xperience. And this consideration, Demea,may,
 I think, fairly serve to abate ourill-4o Dia

which it v-^>-»will be impossible for him eve
r to satisfy himself, consistently with his s
ceptical principles : So that upon the wholen
othing could be more ridiculous thanthe princ
iples of the ancient Pyrrho-ni ans ; if in re
ality they endeavoured,as is pretended, to ex
tend, throughout,the same scepticism, which t
hey hadlearned from the declamations of their
schools, and which they ought to haveconfined
 to them.In this view, there appears a greatr
esemblance between the sects of theStoics and
Pyrrhonians, though perpetual antagonists: an
d both of themseem founded on this erroneous 
maxim,That what a man can perform sometimes, 
and in some dispositions, he canperform alway

die mind cannot, in PartStoicism, support the
 highest flights ofphilosophy ; yet, even whe

er, if a man has accustomed himself to scepti

ose, who either neverformed any opinions in t

avourable to human reason.To whatever length 
any one maypush his speculative principles of
 scepticism, he must act, I own, and live,and
. converse, like other men ; and forthis cond
uct he is not obliged to giveany other reason
, than the absolute necessity he lies under o
f so doing. If heever carries his speculation
s farther thanthis necessity constrains him, 
and philosophises either on natural or morals

and satisfaction which he finds inemploying h
imself after that manner.He considers besides

inual advances in forming more general princi

artquire, and the stronger reason we are «—A-

kind. To philosophise on such subjectsis noth

theology and natural religion. Manyprinciples

them. The Copernican system contains the most
 surprising paradox, andthe most contrary to

ed he, turning himself towardsDemea, a pretty
 curious circumstancein the history of the sc
iences. After theunion of philosophy with the
 popularreligion, upon the first establishmen
t ofChristianity, nothing was more usual,amon
g all religious "teachers, than declamations 
against reason, against thesenses, against ev
ery principle derivedmerely from human resear
ch and inquiry. All the topics of the ancient
 A-cademics were adopted by the Fathers ;and 
thence propagated for several agesinNatural R
eligion. $$in every school and pulpit through
out P*RChristendom. The Reformers embracedthe
 same principles of reasoning, or rather decl
amation; and all panegyricson the excellency 
of faith were sure tobe interlarded with some
 severe strokesof satire against natural reas
on. A celebrated prelate too✳, of the Romishc
ommunion, a man of the most extensive learnin
g, who wrote a demonstration of Christianity,
 has also composeda treatise, which contains 
all the cavilsof the boldest and most determi
nedPyrrhonism. Locke seems to havebeen the fi
rst Christian, who venturedopenly to assert, 
thatfaith was nothingbut a species of reason 
; that religion wasonly a branch of philosoph
y ; and thata chain of arguments, similar to 
thatwhich established any truth in morals,pol
itics, or physics, was always employed in dis
covering all the principles oftheology, natur
al and revealed. The illuse* Mons. Huet.2,6 D
ialogues concerningPart use which Bayle and o

of Mr Locke : And it is now, in a manner, avo

sophy, that Atheist andSceptic are almost syn
onymous. Andas it is certain, that no man is 
in earnestwhen he professes the latter princi
ple;I would fain hope, that there are as feww
ho seriously maintain the former.Don't you re
member, said Philo,the excellent saying of Lo
rd Bacon onthis head? That a little philosoph
y, replied Cleanthes, makes a man anAtheist: 
A great deal converts him toreligion. That is
 a very judicious remark too, said Philo. But
 what I havein my eye is another passage, whe

his heart there is no God, thisgreat philosop
her observes, that the A-theistsNatural Relig
ion. 37theists now-a-days have a double share
 P*RTof folly : for they are not contented to
 ^^>jsay in their hearts there is no God, but
they also utter that impiety with theirlips ;
 and are thereby guilty of multiplied indiscr
etion and imprudence.Such people, though they
 were ever somuch in earnest, cannot, methink
s, bevery formidable.But though you should ra
nk me inthis class of fools, I cannot forbear
 communicating a remark that occurs to mefrom
 the history of the religious andirreligious 
scepticism with which youhave entertained us.
 It appears to me,that there are strong sympt
oms of priestcraft in the whole progress of t
his affair. During ignorant ages, such asthos
e which followed the dissolution ofthe ancien
t schools, the priests perceived, that Atheis
m, Deism, or heresy ofany kind, could only pr
oceed from thepresumptuous questioning of rec
eivedC opinions,38 Dialogues concerningPart o
pinions, and from a belief that humanvw reaso
n was equal to every thing. Education had the
n a mighty influenceover the minds of men, an
d was almostequal in force to those suggestio
ns ofthe senses and common understanding,by w
hich the most determined scepticmust allow hi
mself to be governed. Butat present, when the
 influence of edu-' cation is much diminished
, and men,from a more open commerce of thewor
ld, have learned to compare the popular princ
iples of different nations andages, our sagac
ious divines have changed their whole system 
of philosophy,and talk the language of Stoics
, Pla-tonists, and Peripatetics, not thatof P
yrrhonians and Academics. Ifwe distrust human
 i-eason, we have nowno other principle to le
ad us into religion. Thus, sceptics in one ag
e, dogmatists in another; whichever systembes
t suits the purpose of these reverendgentleme
n^ in giving them an ascendantoverNatural Rel
igion. 39over mankind, they are sure to make 
it Parttheir favourite principle, and establi
shed wjtenet.It is very natural, said Cleanth
es,for men to embrace those principles, bywhi
ch they find they can best defendtheir doctri
nes ; nor need we have anyrecourse to priestc
raft to account for soreasonable an expedient
. And surely,nothing can afford a stronger pr
esumption, that any set of principles are tru
e,and ought to be embraced, than to observe t
hat they tend to the confirmation of true rel
igion, and serve to confound the cavils of At
heists, Libertines,and Freethinkers of all de
nominations.C 2 PARTJIPART II.MUST own, Clean
thes, said PartiiDemea, that nothing can more
 v^jsurprise me, than the light in whichyou h

 nothing but onegreat machine, subdivided int

en their mostminute parts, are adjusted to ea
ch otherwith an accuracy, which ravishes into
admiration all men who have ever contemplated
 them. The curious adaptingof means to ends, 
throughout all nature, resembles exactly, tho
ugh it muchexceeds, the productions ofhuman c
ontrivance;48 Dialogues concerningPart trivan
ce ; of human design, thought,c^w wisdom, and
 intelligence. Since' therefore the effects r
esemble each other, weare led to infer, by al

resemble ; andthat the Author of Nature is so
mewhatsimilar to the mind of man; thoughposse
ssed of much larger faculties, proportioned t
o the grandeur of the workwhich he has execut
ed. By this, argument a posteriori, and by th
is argumentalone, do we prove at once the exi
stence of a Deity, and his similarity tohuman
 mind and intelligence.I shall be so free, Cl
eanthes, saidDemea, as to tell you, that from
 the beginning I could not approve of yourcon
clusion concerning die similarity ofthe Deity
 to men ; still less can I approve of the med
iums by which youendeavour to establish it. W

to been so Partmuch insisted on by philosophe

 nofarther in this subject than experienceand
 probability ? I will not say, that thisis be
traying the cause of a Deity : Butsurely, by 
this affected candor, you giveadvantages to A
theists, which they never could obtain by the
 mere dint ofargument and reasoning.What I ch
iefly scruple in this subject, said Philo, is
 not so much thatall religious arguments are 
by Clean-thes reduced to experience, as thatt
hey appear not to be even the mostcertain and
 irrefragable of that inferiorkind. That a st
one will fall, that firewill burn, that the e
arth has solidity,we have observed a thousand
 and athousand times ; and when any newinstan
ce of this nature is presented, wedraw withou

ct similarity of thecases50 Dialogues concern

 a«^>~i similar event ; and a stronger eviden
ceis never desired nor sought after. Butwhere
-ever you depart, in the least,from the simil

ly the evidence ;and may at last bring it to 
a very weakanalogy^ which is confessedly liab

 in Titius and Mævi-us : But from its circula

 Iallow, that the proofs of a Deity a-mounted

has made of theargument a posteriori ; and fi

uld be upon an equal footing ; nor could he a
ssign any just reason, why he adheres to one 
idea orsystem, and rejects the others whichar
e equally possible.Again ; after he opens his
 eyes, andcontemplates the world as it really
 is,it would be impossible for him, at first,
to assign the cause of any one event,much les

 an infinite variety of reports and represent
ations. These would all be possible ; but bei
ng all equally possible, hewould never, of hi
mself, give a satisfactory account for his pr
eferring oneof them to the rest. Experience a
lonecan point out to him the true cause ofany
 phenomenon*.Now according to this method of'
reasoning, Demea, it follows (and is,indeed, 
tacitly allowed by Cleantheshimself), that or
der, arrangement, orthe adjustment of final c
auses, is not,of itself, any proof of design;
 but onlyso far as it has been experienced to
 proceed from that principle. For aughtwe can
 know a priori, matter may contain the source
 or spring of order originally, within itself
, as well as minddoes; and there is no more d
ifficultyin conceiving, that the several elem
ents,D 2 fromS6 Dialogues concerningpiLRT fro

nto the most exquisite arrangement,.than to c
onceive that their ideas, in thegreat, univer

infer similar causes. The adjustment ofmeanst

lised, I must own, with this resemblance, whi

eatures ; and mustconceive it to imply such a
 degradationof the Supreme Being as no soundT
heist could endure. With your assistance, the
refore, Demea, I shall endeavour to defend wh
at you justly callthe adorable mysteriousness
 of the Divine Nature, and shall refute this 
reasoning of Cleanthes ; provided heallows, t
hat I have made a fair representation of it.W
hen Cleanthes had assented,Phi lo, after a sh

 the same mannerwith animals and vegetables,

you persist in asserting, that all this, atth

to assent, where-ever any reasons strike him 
with so fulla force, that he cannot, without 
thegreatest violence, prevent it. Now theargu

he ancient Platonists,youknow,were the most r
eligious and devout ofall the Pagan philosoph

 expressly declare, that intellect or underst

d that our most perfect wor->ship of him cons
ists, not in acts of veneration, reverence, g
ratitude, or love ;but in a certain mysteriou

oofar stretched; but still it must be acknowl
edged, that, by representing theDeity as so i
ntelligible and comprehensible, and so simila
r to a humanmind, we are guilty of the grosse
st andmost narrow partiality, and make oursel

t us in such a theory. Allour ideas derived f
rom the senses arcconfessedly false and illus

ideas of internal sentiment, added tothose of
 the external senses, compose thewhole furnit

that none of thematerials of thought are in a

 an abuse of terms toapply to it the name of 
thought or reason. At least, if it appear mor

ems strange to me, said Clean-thes, that you,
 Demea, who areso sincere in the cause of rel
igion, shouldstill maintain the mysterious, i
ncomprehensible nature of the Deity, andmould
 insist so strenuously that he hasno manner o
f likeness or resemblance tohuman creatures. 
The Deity, I canreadily allow, possesses many
 powersand attributes, of which. we can have 
nocomprehension: But if our ideas, so faras t
hey go, be not just, and adequate,and corresp

to assign, withcertainty, any other specific

bebe very scrupulous indeed, if they refuse t

logies and unmeaning epithets as you shall pl

 That like effects arise from likecauses : th

 it falls under our knowledge, itbears a grea

te in every part is incessantly repaired: the
 closest sympathy is perceived throughout the
 entire system :and each part or member, in p
erforming its proper offices, operates both t
oits own preservation and to that of thewhole
. The world, therefore, I infer,is an animal 
; and the Deity is theSOUL of the world, actu
ating it, andactuated by it.You have too much
 learning, Cle-anthes, to be at all surprised
 at thisopinion,n6 Dialogues concerningTart o

here, continued Philo, in ex- Partamining the
 ancient system of the «»^wsoul of the world,
 there strikes me, allon a sudden, a new idea
, which, ifjust,must go near to subvert all y
our reasoning, and destroy even your first in
ferences, on which you repose such confidence
. If the universe bears a greaterlikeness to 
animal bodies and to vegetables, than to the 
works of human art,it is more probable, that 
its cause resembles the cause of the former t
hanthat of the laeter, and its origin oughtra
ther to be ascribed to generation orvegetatio
n than to reason or design.Your conclusion, e
ven according to yourown13° Dialogues concern
ingPart own principles, is therefore lame and
v^v-o defective.Pray open up this argument a 
littlefarther, said Demea. For I do notrightl
y apprehend it, in that Concisemanner in whic
h you have expressedit.Our friend Cle.anthes,
 repliedPhilo, as you have heard, asserts, th
atsince no question of fact can be provedothe
rwise than by experience, the existence of a 
Deity admits not of prooffrom any other mediu
m. The world,says he, resembles the works of 
humancontrivance: Therefore its cause mustals
o resemble that of the other. Herewe may rema
rk, that the operation ofone very small part 
of nature, to witman, upon another very small
 part, towit that inanimate matter lying with
inhis reach, is the rule by which Cleanthes j
udges of the origin of the whole;andNatural R
eligion. 131and he measures objects, so widel
y dis- Partproportioned, by the same individu
alstandard. But to wave all objectionsdrawn f
rom this topic; I affirm, thatthere are other
 parts of the universe(besides the machines o
f human invention) which bear still a greater
 resemblance to the fabric of the world, andw
hich therefore afford a better conjecture con
cerning the universal origin ofthis system. T
hese parts are animalsand vegetables. The wor
ld plainly resembles more an animal or a vege
table,than it does a watch or a knitting-loom
.Its cause, therefore, it is more probable,re
sembles the cause of the former. Thecause of 
the former is generation or vegetation. The c
ause, therefore, of theworld, we may infer to
 be something similar or analogous to generat
ion or vegetation.But how is it conceivable, 
said De-mea, that the world can arise from an
ything132 Dialogues concerningPARr thing simi
lar to vegetation or genera-<~~v^j tion?Very 
easily, replied Philo. In likemanner as a tre
e sheds its seed into theneighbouring fields,
 and produces othertrees ; so the great veget
able, the world,or this planetary system, pro
duces within itself certain seeds, which, bei
ng scat*tered into the surrounding chaos, veg
etate into new worlds. A comet, for instance,
 is the seed of a world ; and afterit has bee
n fully ripened, by passingfrom sun to sun, a
nd star to star, it is atlast tossed into the
 unformed elementswhich every where surround 
this universe, and immediately sprouts up int
oa new system.Or if, for the sake of variety 
(for Isee no other advantage), we fliould sup
pose this world to be an animal; a comet is t
he egg of this animal : and inlike manner as 
an ostrich lays its egginNatural Religion. 13

ginary resemblance of the world to a vegetabl
e or an animal sufficient to establish the sa
me inference with regard toboth ? Objects, wh
ich are in general sowidely different; ought 
they to be astandard for each other ?Right, c
ries Philo : This is thetopic on which I have
 all along insisted;I have still asserted, th
at We have nodata to establim any system of c
osmo-*gony. Our experience, so imperfect init
self, and so limited both in extent anddurati
on, can afford us no probableconjecture conce
rning the whole ofthings. But if we must need
s fix onsome hypothesis ; by what rule, pray,
I ought134 Dialogues concerningPart ought we 
to determine our choice ? IsssvJ there any ot

jects compared?And does not a plant or an ani
mal,which springs from vegetation or generati
on, bear a stronger resemblance tothe world, 
than does any artificial machine, which arise
s from reason anddesign ?But what is this veg
etation andgeneration of which you talk, said
Demea? Can you explain their operations, and 
anatomize that fine internalstructure on whic
h they depend ?As much, at least, replied Phi
lo,as Cleanthes can explain the operations of
 reason, or anatomize that internal structure
 on which it depends.But without any such ela
borate disquisitions, when I see an animal, I
 infer,that it sprang from generation ; andth
at with as great certainty as you concludeNat
ural Religion. 135elude a house to have been 
reared by ^TRTTdesign. These words, generatio
n, reason, mark only certain powers andenergi
es in nature, whose effects areknown, but who
se essence is incomprehensible ; and one of t
hese principles,more than the other, has no p
rivilegefor being made a standard to the whol
eof nature.In reality, Demea, it may reasonab
ly be expected, that the larger theviews are 
which we take of things, thebetter will they 
conduct us in our conclusions concerning such
 extraordinaryand such magnificent subjects. 
In thislittle corner of the world alone, ther
eare four principles, Reason, InstinB, Genera
tion, Vegetation, which are similarto each ot
her, and are the causes of similar effects. W
hat a number ofotherprinciples may we natural
ly suppose inthe immense extent and variety o
f theuniverse, could we travel from planet, I
 2 to136 Dialogues concerningPart to planet %
and from system to system,v^r^i in order to e
xamine each part of thismighty fabric ? Any o
ne of these fourprinciples above mentioned (a
nd a hundred others, which lie open to our co
njecture) may afford us a theory, bywhich to 
judge of the origin of theworld; and it is a 
palpable and egregious partiality, to confine
 our viewentirely to that principle by which 
ourown minds operate. Were this principle mor
e intelligible on that account,such a partial
ity might be somewhatexcuseable : But reason,
 in its internalfabric and structure, is real
ly as littleknown to us as instinct or vegeta

t the world arose by o-v-ovegetation from a s
eed shed by anotherworld, than to say that it
 arose from adivine reason or contrivance, ac
cordingto the sense in which Cleanthes unders
tands it.But methinks, said Demea, if theworl
d had a vegetative quality, andcould sow the 
seeds of new worlds intothe infinite chaos, t
his power would bestill an additional argumen
t for designin its author. For whence could a
riseso wonderful a faculty but from design ?O
r how can order spring from anything which pe
rceives not that orderwhich it bestows ?You n
eed only look around you, re-*plied Philo, to
 satisfy yourself withregard to this question
. A tree bestowsorder and organization on tha
t treewhich springs from it, without know-I 3
 inS138 Dialogues concerning^RT ing the order
 : an animal, in the same«-^~» manner, on its
 offspring ; a bird, onits nest : and instanc
es of this kind areeven more frequent in the 
world, thanthose of order, which arise from r

can that great point beascertained otherwise 
than by proving,apriori, .both that order is,
 from its nature, inseparably attached to tho
ught ;and that it can never, of itself, or fr
omoriginal unknown principles, belong tomatte
r.But farther, Demea; this objection,which yo
u urge, can never be madeuse of by Cleanthes,

ready made against one of my objections. When

it is atmy choice. The matter seems entirelya

 faculty, I am equally intitled to ask him th
e cause of hisgreat reasoning principle. Thes
e que-stions we have agreed to forbear onboth

 : ForWe see every day the latter arise fromt

mpare, I beseech you, the consequences on bot
h sides. The world, sayI, resembles an animal
 ; therefore it isan animal, therefore it aro
se from generation. The steps, I confess, are
 wide;yet there is some small appearance ofan
alogy in each step. The world, saysCleanthes,
 resembles a machine;therefore it is a machin
e, therefore itarose from design. The steps h
ere areequally wide, and the analogy less str
iking. And if he pretends to carry onmy hypot
hesis a step farther, and to infer design or 
reason from the great principle of generation

Without any great effort ofthought, I believe
 that I could, in an instant,146 Dialogues co

 Demea, thatmatter can acquire motion, withou

 is the difficulty, repliedPhilo, ofthat supp
osition? Every event,before experience, is eq
ually difficultand incomprehensible ; and eve
ry event,after experience, is equally easy an
d intelligible. Motion, in many instances,fro

 ceconomy or order; andby its very nature, th

 to Philo, saidCleanthes, (though I know that

toNatural Religion. 163to point out the weakn
ess of this meta- p**tphysical reasoning. It 
seems to me so ^^obviously ill-grounded, and 
at the sametime of so little consequence to t

ll myself venttire to show the fallacyof it.I
 shall begin with observing, thatthere is an 
evident absurdity in pretending to demonstrat
e a matter of fact, orto prove it by any argu
ments a priori.Nothing is demonstrable, unles
s thecontrary implies a contradiction. Nothin
g, that is distinctly conceivable, implies a 
contradiction. Whatever wecondeive as existen
t, we can also conceive as non-existent. Ther
e is nobeing, therefore, whose non-existencei
mplies a contradiction. Consequentlythere is 
no being, whose existence isdemonstrable. I p
ropose this argumentas entirely decisive, and
 am willing torest the whole controversy upon
 it.It164 Dialogues concerningPart Xt is pret
ended that the Deity is a^v-J necessarily-exi
stent being; and this necessity of his existe
nce is attempted to beexplained by asserting,
 that, ifwe knewhis whole essence or nature, 
we shouldperceive it to be as impossible for 
himnot to exist as for twice, two not to befo
ur.' But it is evident, that this cannever ha
ppen, while our faculties remain the same as 
at presentL It willstill be possible for us, 
at any time, toconceive the non-existence of 
what weformerly conceived to exist; nor canth
e mind ever lie under a necessity ofsupposing
 any object to remain alwaysin being; in the 
same manner"as we lieunder a necessity of alw
ays conceivingtwice two to be four. The words

pretended Partexplication of necessity? We da
re not «—v^»affirm that we know all the quali
ties ofmatter ; and for aught we can determin
e, it may contain some qualities,which, were 
they known, would makeits non-existence appea
r as great a contradiction as that twice two 
is five. Ifind only one argument employed top
rove, that the material world is notthe neces
sarily-existent Being ; and thisargument is d
erived from the contingency both of the matte
r and the formof the world. " Any particle of
 matter," it is said *, " may be conceived to
w be annihilated ; and any form may*c be conc
eived to be altered. Such an" annihilation or
 alteration, therefore,** is not impossible."
 But it seems agreat partiality not to percei
ve, that thesame argument extends equally to 
theDeity, so far as we have any conception of
 him ; and that the mind can atL least* Dr Cl
arke.i66 Dialogues concerningPart least imagi
ne him to be non-existent,or his attributes t
o be altered. It mustbe some unknown, inconce
ivable qualities, which can make his non-exis
tence appear impossible, or his attributes un
alterable: And no reason canbe assigned, why 
these qualities maynot belong to matter. As t
hey are altogether unknown and inconceivable,
they can never be proved incompatiblewith it.
Add to this, that in tracing an eternal succe
ssion of objects, it seems absurd to inquire 
for a general cause orfirst author. How can a
ny thing, thatexists from eternity, have a ca
use; sincethat relation implies a priority in
 time,and a beginning of existence ?In such a
 chain, too, or succession ofobjects, each pa
rt is caused by thatwhich preceded it, and ca
uses thatwhich succeeds it. Where then is the
difficulty ?Natural Religion. 167difficulty ?
 But the WHOLE, you say, P«Twants a cause. I 
answer, that the uniting of these parts into 
a whole, like theuniting of several distinct 
counties intoone kingdom, or several distinct
 members into one body, is performed merely b
y an arbitrary act of the mind, andhas no inf
luence on the nature of things.Did I show you

terwards ask me, what was the cause ofthewhol

xplaining the cause of theparts.Though the re
asonings which youhave urged, Cleanthes, may 
wellexcuse me, said Philo, from startingany f
arther difficulties ; yet I Cannotforbear ins
isting still upon another topic. It is observ
ed by arithmeticians,that the products of 9 c
ompose alwaysL 3 either1 68 Dialogues concern
ingPart either 9, or some lesser product of 9
 ; ifc-v^ you add together all the characters

 9, you make 9 by adding 1 to 8, 2 to 7, 3 to
 6. Thus, of369 is a product also of 9 ; and 
if youadd 3, 6, and 9, you make 18, a lesserp
roduct of 9 *. To a superficial observer, so 
wonderful a regularity maybe admired as the e
ffect either of chanceor design : but a skilf
ul algebraist immediately concludes it to be 
the workof necessity ; and demonstrates, that
 itmust for ever result from the nature ofthe
se numbers. Is it not probable, Iask, that th
e whole œconomy of theuniverse is conducted b
y a like necessity, though no human algebra c

to me withregard to the present subject. It m
ust,I think, be allowed, that, if a very limi
ted intelligence, whom we mall suppose utterl
y unacquainted with the universe, were assure
d, that it were theproduction of a very good,
 wise, andpowerful Being, however finite, hew
ould, from his Conjectures, form beforehand a
 different notion of it fromwhat we find it t
o be by experience ;nor would he ever imagine
, merelyfrom these attributes of the cause, o
fwhich he is informed, that the effectcould b
e so full of vice and misery andN a disorder,

appears in this life. Sup-wo posing now, that
 this person werebrought into the world, stil

asublime and benevolent Being; hemight, perha
ps, be surprised at the disappointment ; but 
would never retracthis former belief, if foun
ded on anyvery solid argument ; since such a 
limited intelligence must be sensible ofhis o
wn blindness and ignorance, andmust allow, th
at there may be manysolutions of those phenom
ena, whichwill for ever escape his comprehens
ion.But supposing, which is the real cafewith
 regard to man, that this creatureis not ante
cedently convinced of asupreme intelligence, 
benevolent, andpowerful, but is left to gathe
r such abelief from the appearances of things
;this entirely alters the case, nor will heev

t this will not help him in forming P**Tan in

uch subjects are beyond thereach of his facul
ties. You are obliged,therefore, to reason wi
th him merelyfrom the known phenomena, and to
drop every arbitrary supposition or conjectur
e.Did I show you a house or palace,where ther
e was not one apartmentconvenient or agreeabl
e; where thewindows, doors, fires, passages,

 you, that if thisdoor or that window were al

uch a manner, as would haveremedied all or mo
st of these incon-veniencies. His ignorance, 
or evenyour own ignorance of such a plan,will
 never convince you of the impossibility of i
t. If you find many incon-veniencies and defo
rmities in the building, you will always, wit
hout enteringinto any detail, condemn the arc
hitect.InNatural Religictn. 103In short, I re
peat the question: Is Pa*tthe world, consider
ed in general, and «-^~#as it appears to us i
n this life, differentfrom what a man, or suc
h a limitedbeing, would, beforehand, expect f
roma very powerful, wise, and benevolentDeity
 ? It must be strange prejudice toassert the 
contrary. And from thenceI conclude, that, ho
wever consistent theworld may be, allowing ce
rtain suppositions and conjectures, with the 
ideaof such a Deity, it can never afford usan
 inference concerning his existence.The consi
stence is not absolutely denied,only the infe
rence. Conjectures, especially where infinity
 is excluded fromthe divine attributes, may, 
perhaps, besufficient to prove a consistence 
; butcan never be foundations for any inferen
ce.There seem to hefour circumstances,on whic
h depend all, or the greatestpart of the ills
, that molest sensibleN 4 creatures;«©4 Dialo

impossible butv^rv all these circumstances ma
y be necessaryand unavoidable. We know so lit
tle beyond common life, or even of commonlife
, that, with regard to the œconomyof a univer
se, there is no conjecture,however wild, whic
h may not be just ;nor any one, however plaus
ible, whichmay not be erroneous. All that bel
ongs to human understanding, in thisdeep igno
rance and obscurity, is to besceptical, or at
 least cautious ; and notto admit of any hypo
thesis whatever;much less, of any which is su
pportedby no appearance of probability. Nowth
is I assert to be the case with regardto all 
the causes of evil, and the circumstances on 
which it depends. Noneof them appear to human
 reason, inthe least degree, necessary or una
rvoidable; nor can we suppose themsuch, witho
ut the utmost license ofimagination,The,Natur
al Religion. 105The first circumstance which 
intro- pA". . . XI.duces evil, is that contri
vance or ceco- on*-L»nomy of the animal creat
ion, by whichpains, as well as pleasures, are
 employed to excite all creatures to action, 
andmake them vigilant in the great work ofsel
f-preservation. Now pleasure alone,in its var
ious degrees, seems to humanunderstanding suf
ficient for this purpose. All animals might b
e constantlyin a state of enjoyment: but when
urged by any of the necessities of nature, su
ch as thirst, hunger, weariness ; instead of 
pain, they might feela diminution of pleasure
, by whichthey might be prompted to seek that
object which is necessary to their subsistenc
e. Men pursue pleasure as eagerly as they avo
id pain ; at least, mighthave been so constit
uted. It seems,therefore, plainly possible to
 carry onthe business of life without any pai
n.Why then is any animal ever renderedsuscept
ible of such a sensation ? If animals206 Dial

 an hour, theymight enjoy a perpetual exempti
on fromit ; and it required as particular a c
ontrivance of their organs to produce thatfee
ling, as to endow them with sight,hearing, or
 any of the senses. Shallwe conjecture, that 
such a contrivancewas necessary, without any 
appearanceof reason ? and shall we build on t

t,according to the present œconomy ofthe worl
d, the course ofNature, thoughsupposed exactl
y regular, yet to us appears not so, and many
 events are uncertain, and many disappoint ou
r expectations. Health and sickness, calmand 
tempest, with an infinite numberof other acci
dents, whose causes are unknown and variable,
 have a great influence both on the fortunes 
of particular persons and on the prosperity o
fpublic societies : and indeed all humanlife,
 in a manner, depends on such accidents. A be

lies, I own, a contrary way. Religion,however
 corrupted, is still better thanno religion a
t all. The doctrine of afuture state is so st
rong and necessary asecurity to morals, that 
we never oughtto abandon or neglect it. For i
f finiteand temporary rewards and punishments

 vulgar superstition be so salutary tosociety
, that all history abounds somuch with accoun
ts of its perniciousconsequences on public af
fairs ? Factions, civil wars, persecutions, s
ubversions of government, oppression, slavery
; these are the dismal consequenceswhich alwa
ys attend its prevalency overthe minds of men
. If the religiousspirit be ever mentioned in
 any historical narration, we are sure to mee
t afterwards with a detail of the miserieswhi
ch attend it. And no period oftime can be hap
pier or more prosperous,than those in which i
t is never regardedor heard of.The reason of 
this observation, replied Cleanthes, is obvio
us. Theproper244 Dialogues concerningPart pro
per office of religion is to regulate^^j the 
heart of men, humanize their conduct, infuse 
the spirit of temperance,order, and obedience
 ; and as its operation is silent, and only e
nforces themotives of morality and justice, i
t is indanger of being overlooked, and confou
nded with these other motives.When it disting
uishes itself, and acts asa separate principl
e over men, it has departed from its proper s
phere, and hasbecome only a cover to faction 
and ambition.And so will all religion, said P
hilo,except the philosophical and rationalkin
d. Your reasonings are more easilyeluded than
 my facts. The inferenceis not just, because 
finite and temporary rewards and punishments 
have sogreat influence, that therefore such a
sare infinite and eternal must have somuch gr
eater. Consider, I beseech you,the attachment
 which we have to presentNatural Religion. 24

**we discover for objects so remote and v-nr-
»uncertain. When divines are declaiming again
st the common behaviour andconduct of the wor
ld, they always represent this principle as t
he strongestimaginable, (which indeed it is) 
; anddescribe almost all human kind as lyingu
nder the influence of it, and sunk intothe de
epest lethargy and unconcern a-bout their rel
igious interests. Yet thesesame divines, when
 they refute theirspeculative antagonists, su
ppose the motives of religion to be so powerf
ul, that,without them, it were impossible for
civil society to subsist ; nor are they a-sha
med of so palpable a contradiction.It is cert
ain, from experience, that thesmallest grain 
of natural honesty andbenevolence has more ef
fect on mensconduct, than the most pompous vi
ewssuggested by theological theories andsyste
ms. A man's natural inclinationworks incessan
tly \ipon him ; it is forQ^ ever246 Dialogues

is infinitely small, in comparison of that of

bove a great impulse ; because nostrokes or b

 to do with a man,who makes a great professio

er 'effect upon several, who pass for prudent

e cheated and deceived byhim?We must farther 
consider, that phi- 'losophers, who cultivate
 reason and reflection, stand less in need of
 such motives to keep them under the restrain
tof morals : and that the vulgar, whoalone ma
y need them, are utterly incapable of so pure
 a religion as representsQ^2 , the248 Dialogu

 or rapturous ecstasies, or abigotted creduli

nder into remote regions, to find instances o
f thisdegeneracy. Amongst ourselves, somehave
 been guilty of that atrociousness,unknown to
 the Egyptian and Grecian superstitions, of d
eclaiming, inexpress terms, against morality 
; and representing it as a sure forfeiture of
 thedivine favour, if the least trust or reli
ance "be laid upon it.But even though superst

rvals on the temper; and must be rouzedby con
tinual efforts, in order to renderthe pious z

 him fulfil his devotional task. Many religio
us exercisesare entered into with seeming fer
vour,where the heart, at the time, feels cold
and languid: A habit of dissimulation -^is by
 degrees contracted : and fraudand falsehood 
become the predominantprinciple. Hence the re
ason of thatvulgar observation, that the high
est zealin religion and the deepest hypocrisy
,so far from being inconsistent, are oftenor 
commonly united in the same individual charac
ter.(^3 The250 Dialogues concerning*^RT The b

ters toofar: allow not your zeal against fals
ereligion to undermine your venerationfor the
 true. Forfeit not this principle,the chief,

 such a Being himself (if the comparison be a
llowed), the happiest lot whichwe can imagine
, is that of being underhis guardianship and

most engaging and alluring ; and withregard t

not this a proof, that thereligious spirit is
 not so nearly allied tojoy as to sorrow?But 
men, when afflicted, find consolation in reli

: but it is natural to imagine, that they wil

bly to the present gloom and melancholy of th
eir temper, when they betakethemselves to the
 contemplation ofthem.Accordingly, we find th

 the most exalted expression in ourdescriptio

diction, in affirming, thattheNatural Religio
n. 257the damned are infinitely superior in p
ARTnumber to the elect. . k^jI shall venture 
to affirm, that therenever was a popular reli
gion, which represented the state of departed
 souls insuch a light, as would render it eli
giblefor human kind, that there should besuch
 a state. These fine models of religion are t
he mere product of philosophy. For as death l
ies between the eyeand the prospect of futuri
ty, that eventis so shocking to Nature, that 
it mustthrow a gloom on all the regions which
lie beyond it ; and suggest to the generality
 of mankind the idea of Cerberusand Furies ; 
devils, and torrents of fireand brimstone.It 
is true, both fear and hope enterinto religio
n; because both these passions, at different 
times, agitate the human mind, and each of th
em forms aipecies of divinity suitable to its
elf. Butwhen258 Dialogues concerningPart when
 a man is in a cheerful disposition,he is fit
 for business, or company, orentertainment of
 any kind ; and he naturally applies himself 
to these, andthinks not of religion. When mel
ancholy and dejected, he has nothing todo but
 brood upon the terrors of theinvisible world
, and to plunge himselfstill deeper in afflic

aising cheerful prospects of futurity, make h

ph.But still it must be acknowedged, that,as 
terror is the primary principle of religion, 
it is the passion which alwayspredominates in
 it, and admits but ofshort intervals of plea
