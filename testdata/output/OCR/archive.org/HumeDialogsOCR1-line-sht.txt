DIALOGUESconcerningNatural Religion.n—*m+*m+m»m*—*i i -i ;Pamphilus to Hermippus.It has been remarked, my Hermip-pus, that though the ancient philosophers conveyed most of theirinstruction in the form of dialogue, thismethod of composition has been littleA practised6 Dialogues concerningpractised in later ages, and has seldomsucceeded in the hands of those whohave attempted it. Accurate and regular argument, indeed, such as is nowexpected of philosophical inquirers, na-turally throws a man into the methodical and didactic manner ; where he canimmediately, without preparation, explain the point at which he aims; andthence proceed, without interruption,to deduce the proofs on which it isestablished. To deliver a SYSTEM inconversation, scarcely appears natural ;and while the dialogue-writer desires,by departing from the direct style ofrcomposition, to give a freer air to hisperformance, and avoid the appearanceof Author and Reader, he is apt to runinto a worse inconvenience, and conveythe image of Pedagogue and Pupil. Orif he carries on the dispute in the natural spirit of good company, by throwing in a variety of topics, and preserving a proper balance among the speakers;Natural Religion.ers ; he often loses so much time inpreparations and transitions, that thereader will scarcely think himself compensated, by all the graces of dialogue,for the order, brevity, and precisionwhich are sacrificed to them.There are some subjects, however,to which dialogue-writing is peculiarlyadapted, and where it is still preferableto the direct and simple method of composition.Any point of doctrine, which is soolnnous that it scarcely admits of dispute, but at the same time so importantthat it cannot be too often inculcated,seems to require some such method ofhandling it; where the novelty of themanner may compensate the triteness ofthe subject; where the vivacity of conversation may enforce the precept ; andwhere the variety of lights, presentedby various personages and characters,A 2 may8 Dialogues concerningmay appear neither tedious nor redundant.Any question of philosophy, on theother hand, which is so obscure and uncertain, that human reason can reach nofixed determination with regard to it ;if it should be treated at all, seems to leadus naturally into the style of dialogueand conversation. Reasonable men maybe allowed to differ, where no one canreasonably be positive : Opposite sentiments, even without any decision, afford an agreeable amusement : and ifthe subject be curious and interesting,the book carries us, in a manner, into company; and unites the two greatest and purest pleasures of human life,study and society.Happily, these circumstances are allto be found in the subject of NzVTU-<RAL RELIGION. What truth so obvious, so certain, as the being of aGod,Natural Religion.God, which the most ignorant ages haveacknowledged, for which the most refined geniuses have ambitiously strivento produce new proofs and arguments ?What truth so important as this, whichis the ground ofall our hopes, the surestfoundation of morality, the firmest support of society, and the only principlewhich ought never to be a moment absent from our thoughts and meditations? But in treating of this. obviousand important truth ; what obscurequestions occur, concerning the nature of that divine Being ; his attributes, his decrees, his plan of providence? These have been always subjected to the disputations of men: Concerning these, human reason has notreached any certain determination: Butthese are topics so interesting, that wecannot restrain our restless inquiry withregard to them ; though nothing butdoubt, uncertainty, and contradiction,A 3 . have%q Dialogues concerninghave as yet been the result of our mostaccurate researches.This I had lately occasion to observe,while I passed, as usual, part of the summer-season with CLEANTHES, andwas present at those, conversations ofhis with PHILO and DEMEA. of whichI gave you lately some imperfect account. Your curiosity, you then toldme, was so excited, that I must of necessity enter into a more exact detail oftheir reasonings, and display those various systems which they advanced withregard to so delicate a subject as that ofNatural Religion. The remarkable con-trast in their characters still farther raised your expectations ; while you opposed the accurate philosophical turn ofCleanthes to the careless scepticismof Philo, or compared either of theirdispositions with the rigid inflexible orthodoxy of Demea. My youth ren<-dered me a mere auditor of their dis-:putes ;Natural Religion. iiputes ; and that curiosity natural to theearly season of life, has so deeply imprinted in my memory the whole chainand connection of their arguments,that, I hope, I shall not omit or confound any considerable part of them inthe recital.A 4 PART. .•- .C^-vJP AR T I.After Ijoinedthecompany,whom PartI found sitting in Cleanthes's'^.library, Demea paid Cleanthes somecompliments, on the great care whichhe took of my education, and on hisunwearied perseverance and constancyin all his friendships. The father of.Pa mphilu s, said he, was yourintimatefriend: The son is your pupil.; and mayindeed be regarded as your adopted son,were we to judge by the pains whichyou bestow in conveying to him everyuseful branch of literature and science.-You are .no more wanting,. I am persuaded, . in prudence than in industry.I shall, therefore, communicate to you14 Dialogues concerningPart a maxim which I have observed withe-w-* regard to my own children, that I maylearn how far it agrees with your practice. The method I follow in their e-ducation is founded on the saying of anancient, " That students of philosophy** oughtfrst to learn Logics, then Ethics," next Physics, last of all the Nature of" the Gods *." This science of NaturalTheology, according to him, being themost profound and abstruse of any, required the maturest judgment in its students ; and none but a mind, enrichedwith all the other sciences, can safely beentrusted with it.Are you so late, says PhiLO,"m teaching your children the principles of religion? Is there no danger of their neglecting, or rejecting altogether, thoseopinions, of which they have heard solittle during the whole course of theireducation ? It is only as a science, replied* Chryfippus apud Plut. de repug. Stoicorum,Natural Religion. • 15plied Demea, subjected to human rea- j Tsoning and disputation, that I postpone ^^-jthe study of Natural Theology. To season their minds with early piety, is mychief care ; and by continual preceptand instruction, and I hope too by example, I imprint deeply on their tenderminds an habitual reverence for all theprinciples of religion. While they passthrough every other science, I still remark the uncertainty of each part ; theeternal disputations of men ; the obscurity of all philosophy ; and the strange,ridiculous conclusions, which some ofthe greatest geniuses have derived fromthe principles of mere human reason.Having thus tamed their mind to a proper submission and self-diffidence, Ihave no longer any scruple of opening ..to them the greatest mysteries of reli- .gion ; nor apprehend any danger fromthat assuming arrogance of philosophy,which may lead them to reject the mostestablished doctrines and opinions.Your16 Dialogues concerningPart Your precaution, says Philo, ofsea-«^v>j soning your childrens minds early withpiety, is certainly very reasonable ; andno more than is requisite in this profane and irreligious age. But what Ichiefly admire in your plan of education, is your method of drawing advantage from the very principles of philosophy and learning, which, by inspiring pride and self-sufficiency, havecommonly, in all ages, been found sodestructive to the principles of religion.The vulgar, indeed, we may remark,who are unacquainted with science andprofound inquiry, observing the end-less disputes of the learned, have commonly a thorough contempt for Philo-losophy ; and rivet themselves the faster,by that means, in the great points oftheology which have been taught them.Those who enter a little into study andinquiry, finding many appearances ofevidence in doctrines the newest andmost extraordinary, think nothing toodifficultNatural Religion. 17difficult for human reason; and, pre- p£R1fsumptuously breaking thro' all fences,profane the inmost
