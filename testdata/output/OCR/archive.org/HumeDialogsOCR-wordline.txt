that

I

founded
on
the

This

of

according
to
him,
being
themost
profound
and

of

required
the

judgment

But
what
Ichiefly
admire

is
your
method
of
drawing

from
the

Philo,
said

you
think,that

itwill

Butat

when

is

thatall

by
showing
himthe
dangerous
consequences
of
his
tenets,
hope
at

to
reduce

But
what
sticks
most
withyou,
I
observe,
is
the
representationwhich

that,

is

lame
andv^v-o

open

a

said
Demea.
For
I
do
notrightly
apprehend
it,
in
that
Concisemanner
in
which
you
have
expressedit.Our
friend
Cle.anthes,
repliedPhilo,
as
you
have
heard,
asserts,
thatsince
no
question
of

can
be
provedotherwise
than
by

the
existence
of

admits

The

he
measures
objects,
so
widely
dis-
Partproportioned,
by
the
same
individualstandard.
But
to
wave
all
objectionsdrawn
from
this
topic;
I
affirm,
thatthere
are
other
parts
of
the
universe(besides
the
machines
of
human
invention)
which
bear
still
a
greater
resemblance
to
the
fabric
of
the
world,
andwhich
therefore
afford
a
better
conjecture
concerning
the
universal
origin
ofthis
system.
These
parts
are
animalsand
vegetables.
The
world
plainly
resembles
more
an
animal
or
a
vegetable,than
it
does
a
watch
or
a
knitting-loom.Its
cause,
therefore,
it
is
more
probable,resembles
the
cause
of
the
former.
Thecause
of
the
former
is
generation
or
vegetation.
The
cause,
therefore,
of
theworld,
we
may
infer
to
be
something
similar
or
analogous
to
generation
or
vegetation.But
how
is
it
conceivable,
said
De-mea,
that
the
world
can
arise
from
anything132

easily,
replied
Philo.
In

as

and

;
so
the
great
vegetable,
the
world,or
this

system,
produces
within
itself
certain
seeds,
which,
being
scat*tered
into
the
surrounding
chaos,
vegetate
into
new
worlds.
A
comet,

Demea,

Reason,
in

to

never

all

this

yet,
I
know
not,whether,

it
mightnot

to

Instead
of
supposing

infinite,
as

us
suppose
it

A

only

this
supposes,
said
Demea,
thatmatter
can
acquire
motion,
without
anyvoluntary

or

mover.And
where
is
the
difficulty,
repliedPhilo,
ofthat
supposition?
Every

experience,
is
equally

;
and
every
event,after
experience,
is
equally
easy
and
intelligible.
Motion,
in
many
instances,from
gravity,
from
elasticity,
from
e-lectricity,
begins
in
matter,
without
anyknown
voluntary

and
to
suppose
always,
in
these

an

is
mere

and
the
same
stock
of
it,
ornearly
the
same,
be
still
upheld
in

As
much
as
is
lost
by
thecomposition
of

as
much
is
gained

its
resolution.
And
whatever
thecauses
are,
the

is

that

I
repeat
the
question:
Is
Pa*tthe

considered
in

«-^~#as
it
appears
to
us
in

differentfrom
what
a

would,
beforehand,
expect
froma
very
powerful,

and
benevolentDeity
?
It
must
be
strange
prejudice
toassert
the
contrary.
And
from
thenceI
conclude,
that,
however
consistent
theworld
may
be,
allowing
certain
suppositions
and
conjectures,
with
the
ideaof
such
a
Deity,
it
can
never
afford
usan
inference
concerning
his
existence.The
consistence
is
not
absolutely
denied,only
the
inference.

where

perhaps,

to

never

for
any

and
it
is
not
impossible
butv^rv
all
these
circumstances
may
be
necessaryand
unavoidable.
We
know
so
little
beyond
common
life,
or
even
of

that,
with
regard
to
the
œconomyof
a

there
is
no
conjecture,however
wild,
which
may
not
be
just
;nor
any
one,
however
plausible,
whichmay
not
be
erroneous.
All
that
belongs
to

is

besceptical,

I

the

Now
pleasure
alone,in
its

degrees,
seems
to

sufficient
for
this
purpose.
All

but

any
of
the

plainly

Formerly
it
was
a

maintain,
that
human

was
vanity
andmisery,
and
to
exaggerate
all
the
ills

which
are
incident
to
men.
Butof
late
years,
divines,
we
find,
begin
toretract
this
position;
and
maintain,though
still
with
some
hesitation,
thatthere
are
more
goods
than
evils,
more
,pleasures
than
pains,
even
in
this
life.When
religion
stood
entirely
upon
temper
and
education,
it
was
thought
proper
to
encourage
melancholy;
as
indeed,mankind
never
have
recourse
to
superior
powers
so
readily
as
in
that
disposition.
But
as

it

the

I

For

that

true,

because

these
