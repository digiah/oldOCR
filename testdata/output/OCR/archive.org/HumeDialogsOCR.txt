succeeded in the hands of those who
have attempted it. Accurate and regu
lar argument, indeed, such as is now
expected of philosophical inquirers, na-
turally throws a man into the methodi
cal and didactic manner ; where he can
immediately, without preparation, ex
plain the point at which he aims; and
thence proceed, without interruption,
to deduce the proofs on which it is
established. To deliver a SYSTEM in
conversation, scarcely appears natural ;
and while the dialogue-writer desires,
by departing from the direct style ofr
composition, to give a freer air to his
performance, and avoid the appearance
of Author and Reader, he is apt to run
into a worse inconvenience, and convey
the image of Pedagogue and Pupil. Or

ers ; he often loses so much time in
preparations and transitions, that the
reader will scarcely think himself com
pensated, by all the graces of dialogue,
for the order, brevity, and precision
which are sacrificed to them.
There are some subjects, however,
to which dialogue-writing is peculiarly
adapted, and where it is still preferable
to the direct and simple method of com
position.
Any point of doctrine, which is so
olnnous that it scarcely admits of dis
pute, but at the same time so important
that it cannot be too often inculcated,
seems to require some such method of
handling it; where the novelty of the
manner may compensate the triteness of
the subject; where the vivacity of con
versation may enforce the precept ; and
where the variety of lights, presented
by various personages and characters,

may appear neither tedious nor redun
dant.
Any question of philosophy, on the
other hand, which is so obscure and un
certain, that human reason can reach no
fixed determination with regard to it ;
if it should be treated at all, seems to lead
us naturally into the style of dialogue
and conversation. Reasonable men may
be allowed to differ, where no one can
reasonably be positive : Opposite senti
ments, even without any decision, af
ford an agreeable amusement : and if
the subject be curious and interesting,
the book carries us, in a manner, in
to company; and unites the two great
est and purest pleasures of human life,
study and society.
Happily, these circumstances are all
to be found in the subject of NzVTU-<

vious, so certain, as the being of a

God, which the most ignorant ages have

This I had lately occasion to observe,
while I passed, as usual, part of the sum

I gave you lately some imperfect ac

me, was so excited, that I must of ne
cessity enter into a more exact detail of
their reasonings, and display those va
rious systems which they advanced with
regard to so delicate a subject as that of
Natural Religion. The remarkable con-
trast in their characters still farther rai

Cleanthes to the careless scepticism
of Philo, or compared either of their
dispositions with the rigid inflexible or
thodoxy of Demea. My youth ren<-
dered me a mere auditor of their dis-:

early season of life, has so deeply im

After Ijoinedthecompany,whom Part
I found sitting in Cleanthes's'^.
library, Demea paid Cleanthes some
compliments, on the great care which
he took of my education, and on his
unwearied perseverance and constancy
in all his friendships. The father of.
Pa mphilu s, said he, was yourintimate
friend: The son is your pupil.; and may
indeed be regarded as your adopted son,
were we to judge by the pains which
you bestow in conveying to him every
useful branch of literature and science.-
You are .no more wanting,. I am per
suaded, . in prudence than in industry.
I shall, therefore, communicate to you
14 Dialogues concerning
Part a maxim which I have observed with
e-w-* regard to my own children, that I may
learn how far it agrees with your prac
tice. The method I follow in their e-
ducation is founded on the saying of an
ancient, " That students of philosophy
** oughtfrst to learn Logics, then Ethics,
" next Physics, last of all the Nature of
" the Gods *." This science of Natural
Theology, according to him, being the
most profound and abstruse of any, re
quired the maturest judgment in its stu
dents ; and none but a mind, enriched
with all the other sciences, can safely be
entrusted with it.
Are you so late, says PhiLO,"m teach
ing your children the principles of re
ligion? Is there no danger of their ne
glecting, or rejecting altogether, those
opinions, of which they have heard so
little during the whole course of their
education ? It is only as a science, re

plied Demea, subjected to human rea- j T
soning and disputation, that I postpone ^^-j
the study of Natural Theology. To sea
son their minds with early piety, is my
chief care ; and by continual precept
and instruction, and I hope too by ex
ample, I imprint deeply on their tender
minds an habitual reverence for all the
principles of religion. While they pass
through every other science, I still re
mark the uncertainty of each part ; the
eternal disputations of men ; the obscu
rity of all philosophy ; and the strange,
ridiculous conclusions, which some of
the greatest geniuses have derived from
the principles of mere human reason.
Having thus tamed their mind to a pro
per submission and self-diffidence, I
have no longer any scruple of opening ..
to them the greatest mysteries of reli- .
gion ; nor apprehend any danger from
that assuming arrogance of philosophy,
which may lead them to reject the most
established doctrines and opinions.
Your
16 Dialogues concerning
Part Your precaution, says Philo, ofsea-
«^v>j soning your childrens minds early with
piety, is certainly very reasonable ; and
no more than is requisite in this pro
fane and irreligious age. But what I
chiefly admire in your plan of educa
tion, is your method of drawing advan
tage from the very principles of philo
sophy and learning, which, by inspi
ring pride and self-sufficiency, have
commonly, in all ages, been found so
destructive to the principles of religion.
The vulgar, indeed, we may remark,
who are unacquainted with science and
profound inquiry, observing the end-
less disputes of the learned, have com
monly a thorough contempt for Philo-
losophy ; and rivet themselves the faster,
by that means, in the great points of
theology which have been taught them.
Those who enter a little into study and
inquiry, finding many appearances of
evidence in doctrines the newest and
most extraordinary, think nothing too

difficult for human reason; and, pre- p£R1f
sumptuously breaking thro' all fences,
profane the inmost sanctuaries of the
temple. But Cleanthes will, I hope,
agree with me, that, after we have a-
bandoned ignorance, the surest remedy,
there is still one expedient left to pre
vent this profane liberty. LetDemea's
principles be improved and cultivated :
Let us become thoroughly sensible of
the weakness, blindness, and narrow
limits, of human reason: Let us duly
consider its uncertainty and endless
contrarieties, even in subjects of com
mon life and practice: Let the errors
and deceits of our very senses be set
before us ; the insuperable difficulties
which attend first principles in all sy*".

here to the very ideas of matter, cause
and effect, extension, space, time, mo
tion ; and, in a word, quantity of all
kinds, the object of the only science
that can fairly pretend to any certainty

18 Dialogues concerning
Part or evidence. When these topics are dis-3
uwi played in their full light, as they are by
some philosophers and almost all di
vines ; who can retain such confidence
in this frail faculty of reason as to pay
any regard to its determinations in
points so sublime, so abstruse, so re^
mote from common life and experience ?
When the coherence of the parts of a
stone, or even that composition of parts
which renders it extended ; when these
familiar objects, I say, are so inexpli"-
cable, and contain circumstances so
repugnant and contradictory; with
what assurance can we decide concern-
cerning the origin of worlds, or trace
their history from eternity to eternity?
While Philo pronounced these
words, I could observe a smile in the
countenance both of Demea and Cle-
anthes. That of Demea seemed to
imply an unreserved satisfaction in the
doctrines delivered: But, in Clean-
thes's
Natural Religion. 19
Thes's features, I could distinguish an P*RT
air of finesse ; as if he perceived some >^-v~~»
raillery or artificial malice in the rea
sonings of Philo.
You propose then, Philo, said Cle-
Anthes, to erect religious faith on phi-1
losophical scepticism; and you think,
that if certainty or evidence be expelled
from every other subject of inquiry, it
will all retire to these theological dod-
trines, and there acquire a superior force
and authority. Whether your sceptic
cism be as absolute and sincere as you
pretend, we mall learn by and by, when
the company breaks up : We shall then
see, whether you go out at the door or
the window; and whether you really
doubt, if your body has gravity, or can
be injured by its fall; according to po
pular opinion, derived from our falla
cious senses, and more fallacious expe
rience. And this consideration, Demea,
may, I think, fairly serve to abate our

world with their doubts, cavils, and
disputes: If they be only in jest, they
are, perhaps, bad raillers ; but can ne
ver be very dangerous, either to the
state, to philosophy,' or to religion.
" In reality, Philo, continued he, it
seems certain^ that though a man, in a
flush of humour, after intense reflection
on the many contradictions and imper
fections ofhuman reason, may entirely
renounce all belief and Opinion ; it is
impossible for him to' persevere in this
total scepticism, or make it appear in
his conduct fof a few" hours. External
ebjects press in upon him: Passions so
licithim : His philosophical melancholy
dissipates ; and even the utmost vio
lence upon his own temper will not be
able, during any "time, to preserve the

what reason impose on himself such a P*RT
violence? This is a point in which it v-^>-»
will be impossible for him ever to satis
fy himself, consistently with his scepti
cal principles : So that upon the whole
nothing could be more ridiculous than
the principles of the ancient Pyrrho-
ni ans ; if in reality they endeavoured,
as is pretended, to extend, throughout,
the same scepticism, which they had
learned from the declamations of their
schools, and which they ought to have
confined to them.
In this view, there appears a great
resemblance between the sects of the
Stoics andPyrrhonians, though per
petual antagonists: and both of them
seem founded on this erroneous maxim,
That what a man can perform some
times, and in some dispositions, he can
perform always, and in every disposition.

most bodily pain and sufferings will
not prevail over such a high sense of
duty ; and it is possible, perhaps, by
its means, even to smile and exult in
the midst of tortures. If this some
times may be the case in fact and rea
lity, much more may a philosopher,
in his school, or even in his. closet,
work himself up to such an enthusiasm,
and support in imagination the acutest
pain or most calamitous event which he
can possibly conceive. But how shall he
support this enthusiasm itself? The bent
of his mind relaxes, and cannot be re-
- called at pleasure: Avocations lead him
astray: Misfortunes attack him un
awares: And the philosopher sinks by
degrees into the plebeian.

Stoicism, support the highest flights of
philosophy ; yet, even when it sinks low

In like manner, if a man has accustom

reason, he will not entirely forget them
when he turns his reflection on other
subjects ; but in all his philosophical
principles and reasoning, I dare not say
in his common conduct, he will be found

Part different from those, who either never
formed any opinions in the case, or
have entertained sentiments more fa
vourable to human reason.
To whatever length any one may
push his speculative principles of scep
ticism, he must act, I own, and live,
and. converse, like other men ; and for
this conduct he is not obliged to give
any other reason, than the absolute ne
cessity he lies under of so doing. If he
ever carries his speculations farther than
this necessity constrains him, and phi
losophises either on natural or moral
subjects, he is allured by a certain plea
sure and satisfaction which he finds in
employing himself after that manner.
He considers besides, that every one, even
in common life, is constrained to have
more or less of this philosophy; that

tinual advances in forming more gene

ing; that the larger experience we ac- Part
quire, and the stronger reason we are «—A-»
endued with, we always render our
principles the more general and* com
prehensive; and that what we call phi
losophy is nothing but a more regular
and methodical operation of the same
kind. To philosophise on such subjects
is nothing essentially different from rea
soning on common life ; and we may
only expect greater stability, ifnot great
er truth, from our philosophy, on ac
count of its exacter and more scrupu

But when we look beyond human

far removed from the smallest tendency
to scepticism not to be apprehensive,

cious, and who are in danger every Part
moment oftransgressing against the laws <^-~>
and customs of the people with whom
they live and converse. We know not
how far we ought to trust our vulgar
methods of reasoning in such a subject ;
since, even in common life, and in that
province which is peculiarly appro
priated to them, we cannot account for
them, and are entirely guided by a kind
of instinct or necessity in employing
them.
All sceptics pretend, that,. if reason
be considered in an abstract view, it
furnishes invincible arguments against
itself; and that we could never retain
any conviction or assurance, on any
subject, were not the sceptical reason-/
ings so refined and subtile, that they
are not able to counterpoise the more
solid and more natural arguments de
rived from the senses and experience.
But it is evident, whenever our argu-

wide of common life, that the most re
fined scepticism comes to be upon a
footing with them, and is able to op
pose and counterbalance them. The
one has no more weight than the other.
The mind must remain in suspense be
tween them; and it is that very su
spense or balance, which is the triumph
of scepticism.
But I observe, says Cleanthes,
with regard to you, Philci, and all spe
culative sceptics, that your doctrine and
practice are as much at variance in the
most abstruse points of theory as in the
conduct of common life. Where-ever
evidence discovers itself, you adhere
to it, notwithstanding your pretended
scepticism; and I can observe, too, some
of your sect to be as decisive as those
who make greater professions of cer
tainty and assurance. In reality, would

forsooth, too refined for human com

and Galilæo for the motion of the
earth, should with-hold his assent, on
that general principle, That these sub
jects were too magnificent and remote
to be explained by the narrow and fal
lacious reason of mankind ?
There is indeed a kind of brutish
and ignorant scepticism, as you well
observed, which gives the vulgar a ge
neral prejudice against what they do
not easily understand, and makes them
reject every principle which requires
elaborate reasoning to prove and esta
blish it. This species of scepticism is
fatal to knowledge, not to religion;
since

' assent, not only to the great truths of
Theism and natural theology, but even
to the most absurd tenets which a tra*-
ditional superstition has recommend
ed to them. They firmly believe in
witches ; though they will not believe
nor attend to the most simple proposi
tion of Euclid. But the refined and
philosophical sceptics fall into an incon-
' sistence of an opposite nature. They
push their researches into the most ab
struse corners of science; and their
assent attends them in every step, pro

meet with. They are even obliged to
acknowledge, that the most abstruse and
remote objects are those which are best
explained by philosophy. Light is in

mystery : The cohesion of the parts of Part
matter is still incomprehensible. These ^v^#
sceptics, therefore, are obliged, in e-
very question, to consider each parti
cular evidence apart, and proportion
their assent to the precise degree of evi
dence which occurs. This is their prac
tice in all natural, mathematical, moral,
and political science. And why not
the same, I ask, in the theological and
religious ? Why must conclusions of
this nature be alone rejected on the
general presumption of the insufficiency
of human reason, without any parti
cular discussion of the evidence ? Is not
such an unequal conduct a plain proof
of prejudice and passion ?
Our senses, you say, are fallacious;

I shall never assent to so harsh an

who says, that the sceptics are not a sect

without offence) that they are a sect of

In vain would the sceptic make a di
stinction between science and common
life, or between one science and ano
ther. The arguments employed in all,
ifjust, are of a similar nature, and con
tain the same force and evidence. Or
if there be any difference among them,
the advantage lies entirely on the side
of theology and natural religion. Many
principles of mechanics are founded on
very abstruse reasoning ; yet no man
who has any pretensions to science, even
no speculative sceptic, pretends to en
tertain the least doubt with regard to
them. The Copernican system con
tains the most surprising paradox, and
the most contrary to our natural con
ceptions, to appearances, and to our very
senses: yet even monks and inquisitors
are now constrained to withdraw their
opposition to it. And shall Philo, a

And here we may observe, con
tinued he, turning himself towards
Demea, a pretty curious circumstance
in the history of the sciences. After the
union of philosophy with the popular
religion, upon the first establishment of
Christianity, nothing was more usual,
among all religious "teachers, than de
clamations against reason, against the
senses, against every principle derived
merely from human research and in
quiry. All the topics of the ancient A-
cademics were adopted by the Fathers ;
and thence propagated for several ages

in every school and pulpit throughout P*R
Christendom. The Reformers embraced
the same principles of reasoning, or ra
ther declamation; and all panegyrics
on the excellency of faith were sure to
be interlarded with some severe strokes
of satire against natural reason. A ce
lebrated prelate too✳, of the Romish
communion, a man of the most exten
sive learning, who wrote a demonstra
tion of Christianity, has also composed
a treatise, which contains all the cavils
of the boldest and most determined
Pyrrhonism. Locke seems to have
been the first Christian, who ventured
openly to assert, thatfaith was nothing
but a species of reason ; that religion was
only a branch of philosophy ; and that
a chain of arguments, similar to that
which established any truth in morals,
politics, or physics, was always employ
ed in discovering all the principles of

made of the philosophical scepticism of
the fathers and first reformers, still far
ther propagated the judicious sentiment
of Mr Locke : And it is now, in a man
ner, avowed, by all pretenders to rea
soning and philosophy, that Atheist and
Sceptic are almost synonymous. And
as it is certain, that no man is in earnest
when he professes the latter principle;
I would fain hope, that there are as few
who seriously maintain the former.
Don't you remember, said Philo,
the excellent saying of Lord Bacon on
this head? That a little philosophy, re
plied Cleanthes, makes a man an
Atheist: A great deal converts him to
religion. That is a very judicious re
mark too, said Philo. But what I have
in my eye is another passage, where,
having mentioned David's fool, who
said in his heart there is no God, this
great philosopher observes, that the A-
theists

theists now-a-days have a double share P*RT
of folly : for they are not contented to ^^>j
say in their hearts there is no God, but
they also utter that impiety with their
lips ; and are thereby guilty of multi
plied indiscretion and imprudence.
Such people, though they were ever so
much in earnest, cannot, methinks, be
very formidable.
But though you should rank me in
this class of fools, I cannot forbear com
municating a remark that occurs to me
from the history of the religious and
irreligious scepticism with which you
have entertained us. It appears to me,
that there are strong symptoms of priest
craft in the whole progress of this af
fair. During ignorant ages, such as
those which followed the dissolution of
the ancient schools, the priests percei
ved, that Atheism, Deism, or heresy of
any kind, could only proceed from the
presumptuous questioning of received
C opinions,
38 Dialogues concerning
Part opinions, and from a belief that human
vw reason was equal to every thing. Edu
cation had then a mighty influence
over the minds of men, and was almost
equal in force to those suggestions of
the senses and common understanding,
by which the most determined sceptic
must allow himself to be governed. But
at present, when the influence of edu-
' cation is much diminished, and men,
from a more open commerce of the
world, have learned to compare the po
pular principles of different nations and
ages, our sagacious divines have chan
ged their whole system of philosophy,
and talk the language of Stoics, Pla-
tonists, and Peripatetics, not that
of Pyrrhonians and Academics. If
we distrust human i-eason, we have now
no other principle to lead us into reli
gion. Thus, sceptics in one age, dog
matists in another; whichever system
best suits the purpose of these reverend
gentlemen^ in giving them an ascendant
over
Natural Religion. 39
over mankind, they are sure to make it Part
their favourite principle, and established wj
tenet.
It is very natural, said Cleanthes,
for men to embrace those principles, by
which they find they can best defend
their doctrines ; nor need we have any
recourse to priestcraft to account for so
reasonable an expedient. And surely,
nothing can afford a stronger presump
tion, that any set of principles are true,
and ought to be embraced, than to ob
serve that they tend to the confirma
tion of true religion, and serve to con
found the cavils of Atheists, Libertines,
and Freethinkers of all denominations.

be altogether incomprehensible and un
known to us. The essence of that Su
preme Mind, his attributes, the manner
of his existence, the very nature of his
duration ; these, and every particular
which regards so divine a Being, are
mysterious to men. Finite, weak, and
blind creatures, we ought to humble
ourselves in his august presence; and,
conscious of our frailties, adore in si
lence his infinite perfections, which eye
hath not seen, ear hath not heard, nei
ther hath it entered into the heart of
man to conceive. They are covered in a
deep cloud from human curiosity: It is
profaneness to attempt penetrating thro'
these sacred obscurities v And next to
the impiety of denying his existence, is
the temerity of prying into his nature
and essence, decrees and attributes.

After so great an authority, Demea,
replied Philo, as that which you have
produced, and a thousand more which
you might produce, it would appear ri
diculous in me to add my sentiment, or
express my approbation of your doc
trine. But surely, where reasonable
- men

men treat these subjects, the question Part
can never be concerning the Being, but <-^~^
only the Nature, of the Deity. The for
mer truth, as you well observe, is un
questionable and self-evident. Nothing
exists without a cause ; and the original
cause of this universe (whatever it be)
we call God ; and piously ascribe to him
every species of perfection. "Whoever
scruples this fundamental truth, de
serves every punishment which can be
inflicted among philosophers, to wit, the
greatest ridicule, contempt, and disap
probation. But as all perfection is en
tirely relative, we ought never to ima
gine that we comprehend the attri
butes of this divine Being, or to sup
pose that his perfections have any ana
logy or likeness to the perfections of a
human creature. Wisdom, Thought,
Design, Knowledge ; these we justly a?
scribe to him; because these words are x
honourable among men, and we have
no other language or other conceptions

Part by which we can express our adoration
i^it of him. But let us beware, lest we think,
that our ideas any wise correspond to
his perfections, or that his attributes
have any resemblance to these qualities
among men. He is infinitely superior
to our limited view and comprehension ;
and is more the object of worship in the
the temple, than of disputation in the
schools.
In reality, Cleanthes, continued
he, there is no need of having recourse
to that affected scepticism, so displeafing
to you, in order to come at this deter
mination. Our ideas reach no farther
than our experience: We have no expe
rience of divine attributes and opera
tions: I need not conclude my syllo
gism : You can draw the inference your
self. And it is a pleasure to me (and I
hope to you too) that just reasoning and
sound piety here concur in the same
conclusion, and both of them establish
the
Natural Religion. 47
the adorably mysterious and incompre- Part
hensible nature of the Supreme Being. v^-vO
Not to lose any time in circumlocu
tions, said Cleanthes, addressing him
self to Demea, much less in replying
to the pious declamations of Philo; I
shall briefly explain how I conceive this
matter. Look round the world: con
template the whole and every part of it:
You will find it to be nothing but one
great machine, subdivided into an infi
nite number of lesser machines, which
again admit of subdivisions to a degree
beyond what human senses and facul
ties can trace and explain. All these
various machines, and even their most
minute parts, are adjusted to each other
with an accuracy, which ravishes into
admiration all men who have ever con
templated them. The curious adapting
of means to ends, throughout all na
ture, resembles exactly, though it much
exceeds, the productions ofhuman con
trivance;
48 Dialogues concerning
Part trivance ; of human design, thought,
c^w wisdom, and intelligence. Since' there
fore the effects resemble each other, we
are led to infer, by all the rules of ana
logy, that the causes also resemble ; and
that the Author of Nature is somewhat
similar to the mind of man; though
possessed of much larger faculties, pro
portioned to the grandeur of the work
which he has executed. By this, argu
ment a posteriori, and by this argument
alone, do we prove at once the exist
ence of a Deity, and his similarity to
human mind and intelligence.
I shall be so free, Cleanthes, said
Demea, as to tell you, that from the be
ginning I could not approve of your
conclusion concerning die similarity of
the Deity to men ; still less can I ap
prove of the mediums by which you
endeavour to establish it. What! No
demonstration of the Being ofGod ! No
abstract arguments ! No proofs a priori!

Are these, which have hitherto been so Part
much insisted on by philosophers, all ^^j
fallacy, all sophism? Can we reach no
farther in this subject than experience
and probability ? I will not say, that this
is betraying the cause of a Deity : But
surely, by this affected candor, you give
advantages to Atheists, which they ne
ver could obtain by the mere dint of
argument and reasoning.
What I chiefly scruple in this sub
ject, said Philo, is not so much that
all religious arguments are by Clean-
thes reduced to experience, as that
they appear not to be even the most
certain and irrefragable of that inferior
kind. That a stone will fall, that fire
will burn, that the earth has solidity,
we have observed a thousand and a
thousand times ; and when any new
instance of this nature is presented, we
draw without hesitation the accustomed
inference. The exact similarity of the
cases
50 Dialogues concerning
Part cases gives us a perfect assurance of a
«^>~i similar event ; and a stronger evidence
is never desired nor sought after. But
where-ever you depart, in the least,
from the similarity of the cases, you di
minish proportionably the evidence ;
and may at last bring it to a very weak
analogy^ which is confessedly liable to
error and uncertainty. After having
experienced the circulation of the blood
in human creatures, we make no doubt
that it takes place in Titius and Mævi-
us : But from its circulation in frogs
and fishes, it is only a presumption,
though a strong one, from analogy, that
it takes place in men and other animals.
The analogical reasoning is much weak
er, when we infer the circulation of
the sap in vegetables from our experi
ence that the blood circulates in ani
mals ; and those, who hastily followed
that imperfect analogy, are found, by
more accurate experiments, to have been
mistaken.

conclude, with the greatest certainty, v^»

cause this is precisely that species of

surely you will not affirm, that the
universe bears such a resemblance to a
house, that we can with the same cer
tainty infer a similar cause, or that the
analogy is here entire and perfect. The
dissimilitude is so striking, that the ut
most you can here pretend to is a guess,
a conjecture, a presumption concern
ing a similar cause ; and how that pre
tension will be received in the world, I
leave you to consider.
It would surely be very ill received,
replied Cleanthes; and I should be
deservedly blamed and detested, did I
allow, that the proofs of a Deity a-
mounted to no more than a guess or
conjecture. But is the whole adjust
ment
52 Dialogues concerning
Part ment of means to ends in a house and in
the universe so slight a resemblance?
The œconomy of final causes ? The
order, proportion, and arrangement of
every part ? Steps of a stair are plainly
contrived, that human legs may use
them in mounting ; and this inference
is certain and infallible. Human legs
are also contrived for walking and
mounting; and this inference, I allow,
is not altogether so certain, because of
the dissimilarity which you remark;
but does it, therefore, deserve the name
only of presumption or conjecture ?
Good God! cried Demea, inter
rupting him, where are we ? Zealous
defenders of religion allow, that the
proofs of a Deity fall short of perfect
evidence! And you, Philo, on whose
assistance I depended in proving the
adorable mysteriousness of the Divine
Nature, do you assent to all these extra
vagant opinions of Cleanthes ? For
what

You" seem not to apprehend, replied
Philo, that I argue with Cleanthes
in his own way; and by showing him
the dangerous consequences of his te
nets, hope at last to reduce him to our
opinion. But what sticks most with
you, I observe, is the representation
which Cleanthes has made of the
argument a posteriori ; and finding that
that argument is likely to escape your
hold and vanish into air, you think it
so disguised, that you can scarcely be
lieve it to be set in its true light. Now,
however much I may dissent, in other
respects, from the dangerous principles
of Cleanthes, I must allow, that he
has fairly represented that argument;

. Were a man to abstract from every
v thing which he knows or hasT seen, he
would be altogether incapable, merely
from his own ideas, to determine what
kind of scene the universe must be, or
to give the preference to one state or
situation of things above another. For
as nothing which he clearly conceives
could be esteemed impossible or imply
ing a contradiction, every chimera of
his fancy would be upon an equal foot
ing ; nor could he assign any just rea
son, why he adheres to one idea or
system, and rejects the others which
are equally possible.
Again ; after he opens his eyes, and
contemplates the world as it really is,
it would be impossible for him, at first,
to assign the cause of any one event,
much less of the whole of things or of
the
JMATUfeAl Religion. 5$
the universe. He might set his Fancy ?^
a rambling ; and she might bring him ^w
in an infinite variety of reports and re
presentations. These would all be pos
sible ; but being all equally possible, he
would never, of himself, give a satis
factory account for his preferring one
of them to the rest. Experience alone
can point out to him the true cause of
any phenomenon*.
Now according to this method of'
reasoning, Demea, it follows (and is,
indeed, tacitly allowed by Cleanthes
himself), that order, arrangement, or
the adjustment of final causes, is not,
of itself, any proof of design; but only
so far as it has been experienced to pro
ceed from that principle. For aught
we can know a priori, matter may con
tain the source or spring of order ori
ginally, within itself, as well as mind
does; and there is no more difficulty
in conceiving, that the several elements,
D 2 from
S6 Dialogues concerning
piLRT from an internal unknown cause, may
<^vs»i fall into the most exquisite arrangement,.
than to conceive that their ideas, in the
great, universal mind, from a like in
ternal unknown cause, fall into that
arrangement. The equal possibility of
both these suppositions is allowed. But
by experience we find, (according to
Cleanthes), that there is a difference
between them. Throw several pieces
ofsteel together, without shape or form;
they will never arrange themselves so as
to compose a watch. Stone, and mor
tar, and wood, without an architect,
never erect a house. But the ideas in
a human mind,. we see, by an un
known, inexplicable œconomy, arrange
themselves so as to form the plan of a
watch or house. Experience, therefore,
proves, that there is an original prin
ciple of order in mind, not in mat
ter. From similar effects we infer si
milar causes. The adjustment ofmeans
to ends is alike in the universe, as in a
machine

machine of human contrivance. The P*RT
causes, therefore, must be resembling. <—»~»
I was from the beginning scanda
lised, I must own, with this resem
blance, which is asserted, between the
Deity and human creatures ; and must
conceive it to imply such a degradation
of the Supreme Being as no sound
Theist could endure. With your assi
stance, therefore, Demea, I shall en
deavour to defend what you justly call
the adorable mysteriousness of the Di
vine Nature, and shall refute this rea
soning of Cleanthes ; provided he
allows, that I have made a fair repre
sentation of it.
When Cleanthes had assented,
Phi lo, after a short pause, proceeded in
the following manner.
That all inferences, Cleanthes,
concerning fact, are founded on expe-
D 3 > rience;
58 Dialogues concerning
P**T rience ; and that all experimental rea-^
vw.sonings are. founded on the supposition,
that similar causes prove similar effects,
and similar effects similar causes ; I shall
not, at present, much dispute with you.
But observe, I intreat you, with what
extreme caution all just reasoners pro-
ceed in the transferring of experiments
to similar cases. Unless the cases be
exactly similar, they repose no perfect
confidence in applying their past obser
vation to any particular phenomenon.
Every alteration of circumstances oc-*
casions a doubt concerning the event ;
and it requires new experiments to
prove certainly, that the new circum
stances are of no moment or impor
tance. A change in bulk, situation,
arrangement, age, disposition of the air,
or surrounding bodies ; any of these
particulars may be attended with the
most unexpected consequences : And

assurance, after any of these changes, an Part
event similar to that which before fell «^>rl>
under our observation. The slow and
deliberate steps of philosophers, here, if
any where, are distinguished from the
precipitate march of the vulgar, who,
hurried on by the smallest similitude,
are incapable of all discernment or con
sideration.
But can you think, Clean thes,
that your usual phlegm and philosophy
have been preserved in so wide a step as
you have taken, when you compared to
the universe, houses, ships, furniture,
machines ; and from their similarity in
some circumstances inferred a similari
ty in their causes ? Thought, design,
intelligence, such as we discover in men
and other animals, -is no more than one
of the springs and principles ofthe uni
verse, as well as heat or cold, attraction
or repulsion, and a hundred others,
which fall under daily observation. It
D 4 is
6o Dialogues concerning

k^vsj ticular parts of nature, we find, pro
duce alterations on other parts. But
can a conclusion, with any propriety,
be transferred from parts to the whole ?
Does not the great disproportion bar all
comparison and inference ? From ob
serving the growth of a hair, can we

known, afford us any instruction con

But allowing that we were to take
the operations of one part of nature up
on another for the foundation of our
judgment concerning the origin of the
whole, (which never can be admitted) ;
yet why select so minute, so weak, so
bounded a principle as the reason and
design of animals is found to be upon
this planet ? What peculiar privilege has
this little agitation of the brain which
we

we call thought, that we must thus make Part
it the model of the whole universe ?
Our partiality in our own favour does
indeed present it on all occasions ; but
sound philosophy ought carefully to
guard against so natural an illusion.
So far from admitting, continued
Philo, that the operations of a part can
afford us any just conclusion concerning
the origin of the whole, I will not allow
any one part to form a rule for another
part, if the latter be very remote from
the former. Is there any reasonable
ground to conclude, that the inhabi
tants of other planets possess thought,
intelligence, reason, or any thing simi
lar to these faculties in men? "When
nature has so extremely diversified her
manner of operation in this small globe;
can we imagine, that she incessantly co
pies herself throughout so immense a
universe ? And if thought, as we may
well suppose, be confined merely to this

propriety can we assign it for the ori
ginal cause of all things ? The narrow
views of a peasant, who makes his do
mestic œconomy the rule for the go
vernment of kingdoms, is in compari
son a pardonable sophism.
But were we ever so much assured,
that a thought and reason, resembling
the human, were to be found through
out the whole universe, and were its ac
tivity elsewhere vastly greater and more
commanding than it appears in this
globe; yet I cannot see, why the opera
tions of a world constituted, arranged,
adjusted, can with any propriety be
extended to a world which is in its
embryo-state, and is advancing towards
that constitution and arrangement. By
observation, we know somewhat of the

incessantly discover themselves on every

wide of the former ? Is it a rule for the
, whole? Is a very small part a rule for
the universe ? Is nature in one situa
tion, a certain rule for nature in ano
ther situation vastly different from the
former ?
And can you blame me, Cleanthes,
if I here imitate the prudent reserve of
Simonides, who, according to the no
ted story, being asked by Hi ero, What
God ivas ? desired a day to think of it,
and then two days more; and after that
manner continually prolonged the term,

not knoivi and was sensible that this sub- Part
ject lay vastly beyond the reach of my i^-v-^/
faculties? You might cry out sceptic
and rallier, as much as you pleased: but
having found, in so many other sub
jects ijiuch more familiar, the imper
fections and even contradictions of hu
man reason, I never should expect any
success from its feeble conjectures, in a
subject so sublime, and so remote from
the sphere of our observation. I When
two species of objects have always been
observed to be conjoined together, I can
infer, by custom, the existence of one
wherever I fee the existence of the other:
and this I call an argument from expe
rience. But how this argument can
have place, where the objects, as in the
present case, are single, individual, with
out parallel, or specific resemblance,
may be difficult to explain. And will
any man tell me with a serious counte
nance, that an orderly universe must a-
rise from some thought and art, like
the
66 Dialogues concerning
Part the human; because we have experi-
«^>Aj ence of it? To ascertain this reasoning,
it were requisite, that we had experience
of the origin of worlds; and it is not
sufficient, surely, that we have seen ships
and cities arise from human art and
contrivance.
Philo was proceeding in this vehe
ment manner, somewhat between jest
and earnest, as it appeared to me ; when
he observed some signs of impatience
in Cleanthes, and then immediately
stopped short. What I had to suggest,
said Cleanthes, is only that you
would not abuse terms, or make use of
popular expressions to subvert philoso^
phical reasonings. You know, that the
vulgar often distinguish reason from ex^
perience, even where the question re
lates only to matter of fact and exist
ence; though it is found, where that
reason is properly analyzed, that it is no
thing but a species of experience. To
prove
Natural Religion. f 67
prove by experience the origin of the Part
universe from mind, is not more con- *~^j
trary to common speech, than to prove
the motion of the earth from the same
principle. And a caviller might raise
all the same objections to the Coper-
nican system, which you have urged
against my reasonings. Have you other
earths, might he say, which you have
seen to move ? Have
Yes! cried Philo, interrupting him,
we have other earths. Is not the moon
another earth, which we see to turn
round its centre ? Is not Venus another
earth, where we observe the same phe
nomenon ? Are not the revolutions of
the sun also a confirmation, from ana
logy, of the same theory ? All the pla
nets, are they not earths, which revolve
about the sun? Are not the satellites
moons, which move round Jupiter and
Saturn, and along with these primary
planets round the sun? These analogies
and
68 Dialogues concerning
**RT and resemblances, with others which I
^y~» have not mentioned, are the sole proofs
of the Copernican system: and to
you it belongs to consider, whether you
have any analogies of the same kind to
support your theory.
In reality, Cleanthes, continued he,
the modern system of astronomy is now
so much received by all inquirers, and
has become so essential a part even of
our earliest education, that we are not
commonly very scrupulous in examin
ing the reasons upon which it is found
ed. It is now become a matter of mere
curiosity to study the first writers on
that subject, who had the full force of
prejudice to encounter, and were obli
ged to turn their arguments on every
side in order to render them popular
and convincing. But if we peruse Ga-
lilæo's famous Dialogues concerning
the system of the world, we shall find,
that that great genius, one of the sub-
4 limest
Natural Religion. 69
limest that ever existed, first bent all P*RT
his endeavours to prove, that there w-v^
was no foundation for the distinc
tion commonly made between elemen
tary and celestial substances. The
schools, proceeding from the illusions of
sense, had carried this distinction very
far ; and had established the latter sub
stances to be ingenerable, incorruptible,
unalterable, impassible ; and had as
signed all the opposite qualities to the
former. But Galilæo, beginning with
the moon, proved its similarity in every
particular to the earth; its convex fi
gure, is natural darkness when not il
luminated, its density, its distinction in
to solid and liquid, the variations of its
phases, the mutual illuminations of the
earth and moon, their mutual eclipses,
the inequalities of the lunar surface, &c
After many instances of this kind, with
regard to all the planets, men plainly

tend the same arguments and pheno
mena from one to the other.
In this cautious proceeding of the
astronomers, you may read your own
condemnation, Cleanthes; or rather
may see, that the subject in which you
are engaged exceeds all human reason
and inquiry. Can you pretend to show
any such similarity between the fabric
of a house, and the generation of a uni
verse ?. Have you ever seen Nature in
any such situation as resembles the first
arrangement of the elements ? Have
worlds ever been formed under your
eye ; and have you had leisure to ob
serve the whole progress of the pheno
menon, from the first appearance of
order to its final consummation? If you
have, then cite your experience, and

you not aware, Philo, that it became

several philosophers, blinded by old sy
stems, and supported by some sensible
appearances, had denied this similarity?
but that it is by no means necessary,
that Theists mould prove the similarity

Your objections, I must freely tell you,
are no better than the abstruse cavils of
those philosophers who denied motion;
and ought to be refuted in the same

Suppose, that this voice were extended

must you not instantly ascribe it to some

all the same objections (if they merit
that appellation) which lie against the

ced against vthis inference.
Might you not say, that all conclu
sions concerning fact were founded on
experience: that when we hear an arti
culate voice in the dark, and thence in
fer a man, it is only the resemblance of
the effects which leads us to conclude
that there is a like resemblance in the
cause : but that this extraordinary voice,
by its loudness, extent, and flexibility
to all languages, bears so little analogy
to any human voice, that we have no
reason to suppose any analogy in their
causes : and consequently, that a ra

You see clearly your own objections in
these cavils ; and I hope too, you see
clearly, that they cannot possibly have
more force in the one case than in the
other.
But to bring the cafe still nearer the
present one of the universe, I shall make
two suppositions, which imply not any
absurdity or impossibility. Suppose,
that there is a natural, universal, inva?
riable language, common to every in
dividual of human race; and that books
are natural productions, which perpe-r
tuate themselves in the same manner
with animals and vegetables, by descent
and propagation. Several expressions of
our passions contain a universal lan
guage: all brute animals have a natural

courses ; when it expostulates, argues,

it applies sometimes to the pure intel
lect, sometimes to the affections ; when
it collects, disposes, and adorns every
consideration suited to the subject: could

between this supposed case and the real

Cleanthes, that this religious argu- w>^
ment, instead of being weakened by
that scepticism so much affected by

becomes more firm and undisputed. To
exclude all argument or reasoning of
every kind, is either affectation or mad

struse, remote, and refined arguments ;
to adhere to common sense and the plain
instincts ofnature ; and to assent, where-
ever any reasons strike him with so full

greatest violence, prevent it. Now the
arguments &r Natural Religion are
plainly of this kind ; and nothing but
the most perverse, obstinate metaphysics
can reject them. Consider, anatomize

not immediately flow in upon you with

from effects : You can compare the most

Your instance, Cleanthes,said he,

familiar, has, I confess, so much more
force on that account : but is there not
some danger too in this very circum
stance ; and may it not render us pre
sumptuous, by making us imagine we

adequate idea of his nature and attri
butes? When I read a volume, I enter
into the mind and intention of the au
thor: I become him, in a manner, for
the instant; and have an immediate
feeling and conception of those ideas
which revolved in his imagination while
employed in that composition. But so
near an approach we never surely can
make to the Deity. His ways are not

but incomprehensible. And this vo
lume of Nature contains a great and in

The ancient Platonists,youknow,
were the most religious and devout of
all the Pagan philosophers : yet many
of them, particularly Plotinus, ex
pressly declare, that intellect or under
standing is not to be ascribed to the
Deity ; and that our most perfect wor->
ship of him consists, not in acts of ve
neration, reverence, gratitude, or love ;
but in a certain mysterious self-annihi
lation, or total extinction of all our fa
culties. These ideas are, perhaps, too
far stretched; but still it must be ac
knowledged, that, by representing the
Deity as so intelligible and compre
hensible, and so similar to a human
mind, we are guilty of the grossest and
most narrow partiality, and make our
selves the model of the whole universe.
All thefentiments ofthe human mind,

approbation, blame, pity, emulation, ^v^j

and situation of man, and are calcula
ted for preserving the existence and
promoting the activity of a such a be
ing in such circumstances. It seems
therefore unreasonable to transfer such
sentiments to a supreme existence, or to
suppose him actuated by them ; and the
phenomena, besides, of the universe will
not support us in such a theory. All
our ideas derived from the senses arc
confessedly false and illusive; and can
not, therefore, be supposed to have place
in a supreme intelligence: And as the
ideas of internal sentiment, added to
those of the external senses, compose the
whole furniture of human understand
ing, we may conclude, that none of the
materials of thought are in any respect
similar in the human and in the divine
intelligence. Now as to the manner of
thinking ; how can we make any com

fluctuating, uncertain, fleeting, succes
sive, and compounded ; and were we to
remove these circumstances, we abso
lutely annihilate its essence, and it would
in such a case be an abuse of terms to
apply to it the name of thought or rea
son. At least, if it appear more pious
and respectsul (as it really is) still to
retain these terms, when we mention the
Supreme Being; we ought to acknow
ledge, that their meaning, in that case,
is totally incomprehensible ; and that the
infirmities of our nature do not permit
us to reach any ideas which in the least
correspond to the ineffable sublimity of
the divine attributes.

It seems strange to me, said Clean-

so sincere in the cause of religion, should
still maintain the mysterious, incom
prehensible nature of the Deity, and
mould insist so strenuously that he has
no manner of likeness or resemblance to
human creatures. The Deity, I can
readily allow, possesses many powers
and attributes, of which. we can have no
comprehension: But if our ideas, so far
as they go, be not just, and adequate,
and correspondent to his real nature, I
know not what there is in this subject
worth insisting on. Is the name, with

I can readily allow, said Cleanthe s, ^
that those who maintain the perfect sim
plicity of the Supreme Being, to the ex
tent in which you have explained it,
are complete Mystics, and chargeable
with all the consequences which I have
drawn from their opinion. They are,
in a word, Atheists, without knowing
it. For though it be allowed, that the
Deity possesses attributes of which we
have no comprehension ; yet ought we
never to ascribe to him any attributes
which are absolutely incompatible with
that intelligent nature essential to him.
A mind, whose acts and sentiments and
ideas are not distinct and successive ;
one, that is wholly simple, and totally
immutable ; is a mind, which has no
thought, no reason, no will, no senti
ment, no love, no hatred ; or in a word,
is no mind at all. It is an abuse of
terms to give it that appellation ; and
we may as well speak of limited exten-

Pray consider, said Philo, whom
you are at present inveighing against.
You are honouring with the appellation
of Atheist all the sound, orthodox di
vines, almost, who have treated of this
subject ; and you will at last be, your
self, found, according to your reckon
ing, the only sound Theist in the world.
But if idolaters be Atheists, as, I think,
may justly be asserted, and Christian
Theologians the same ; what becomes
of the argument, so much celebrated,
derived from the universal consent of
mankind?
But because I know you are not
much swayed by names and authorities,
I mall endeavour to show you, a little
more- distinctly, the inconveniencies of
that Anthropomorphism, which you
fyave embraced ; and shall prove, that
there

there is no ground to suppose a plan of p£*
the world to be formed in the divine ^—i
mind, consisting of distinct ideas, dif
ferently arranged ; in the same manner
as an architect forms in his head the
plan of a house which he intends to
execute.
It is not easy, I own, to see what
is gained by this supposition, whether
we judge of the matter by Reason or by
Experience. We are still obliged to
mount higher, in order to find the
cause of this cause, which you had as
signed as satisfactory and conclusive.
If Reason (I mean abstract reason,
derived from inquiries a priori) be not
alike mute with regard to all questions
concerning cause and effect ; this sen
tence at least it will venture to pro
nounce, That a mental world, or uni
verse ofideas, requires a cause as much,
as does a material world, or universe of
F 4 objects; .
92 Dialogues concerning
Part objects ; and, if similar in its arrange-
^r^j ment, must require a similar cause. For
what is there in this subject, which
fliould occasion a different conclusion or
. inference ? In an abstract view, they
are entirely alike ; and no difficulty at
tends the one supposition, which is not
common to both of them. .
Again, when we will needs force
Experience to pronounce some sentence,
even on these subjects, which lie beyond
her sphere; neither can she perceive
any material difference in this particu
lar, between these two kinds of worlds ;
but finds them to be governed by simi
lar principles, and to depend upon an
equal variety of causes in their opera
tions. We have specimens in minia
ture of both of them. Our own mind
resembles the one: A vegetable or ani
mal body the other. Let Experience,
therefore, judge from these samples.
Nothing seems more delicate, with re-
• gard
Natural Religion. 93
gard to its causes, than thought ; and as Part
these causes never operate in two per- v^>-l/
sons after the same manner, so we never
find two persons who think exactly a-
like. Nor indeed does the same person
think exactly alike at any two different
periods of time. A difference of age,
of the disposition of his body, of wea
ther, of food, of company, of books,
ofpassions ; any of these particulars, or
others more minute, are sufficient to
alter the curious machinery of thought,
and communicate to it very different
movements and operations. As far as
we can judge, vegetables and animal
bodies are not more delicate in their
motions, nor depend upon a greater
. variety or more curious adjustment of
springs and principles.
How therefore shall we satisfy our
selves concerning the cause of that Be
ing, whom you suppose the Author of
Nature, or, according to your system
of
94 Dialogues concerning
P**T ofAnthropomorphism, the ideal world,
c-v^i into which you trace the material ?
Have we not the same reason to trace
that ideal world into another idealworld,
or new intelligent principle ? But if we
stop, and go no farther ; why go so far ?
Why not stop at the material world ?
How can we satisfy ourselves without
going on in infnitum? And after all,
what satisfaction is there in that infinite
progression ? Let us remember the story
of the Indian philosopher and his ele
phant. It was never more applicable
than to the present subject. If the ma
terial world rests upon a similar ideal
world, this ideal world must rest upon
some other ; and so one, without end.
It were better, therefore, never to look
beyond the present material world. By
supposing it to contain the principle of
its order within itself, we really assert it
to be God ; and the sooner we arrive at
that divine Being, so much the better:
When you go one step beyond the mun
dane

dane system, you only excite an inqui- Part
sitive humour, which it is impossible i^-vO
ever to satisfy.
To say, that the different ideas, which
compose the reason of the Supreme Be
ing, fall into order, of themselves, and
by their own nature, is really to talk
without any precise meaning. If it has
a meaning, I would fain know, why it
is not as good fense to say, that the parts
of the material world fall into order, of
themselves, and by their own nature.
Can the one opinion be intelligible,
while the other is not so ?
We have, indeed, experience ofideas,
which fall into order, of themselves,
and without any known cause : But, I
am sure, we have a much larger expe
rience of matter, which does the same;
as in all instances of generation and ve
getation, where the accurate analysis of
the cause exceeds all human compre
hension.
96 Dialogues concerning
Part hehsion. We have also experience of
»^v0 particular systems of thought and of
matter, which have no order: of the
first, in madness ; of the second, in
corruption. Why then should we think,
that order is more essential to one than
the other ? And if it; requires a cause in
both, what do we gain by your system,
in tracing the universe of objects into a
similar universe of ideas ? The first step,
which we make, leads us on for ever.
It were, therefore, wise in us, to limit
all our inquiries to the present world,
without looking farther. No satisfac
tion can ever be attained by these spe
culations, which so far exceed the nar
row bounds of human -understanding.

ed a cause from our experience of the
narrow productions of human design
and invention.-
The discoveries by microscopes, as
they open a new universe in miniature,

And what say you to the discoveries

still the image of mind reflected on
iiS' from innumerable objects. Add,
a mind like the human, said Philo. I
know of no other, replied Cleanthes.
And the liker the better, insisted Philo.
To be sure, said Cleanthes.
Now, Cleanthes, said Philo, with
an air of alacrity and triumph, mark
the consequences. First, By this me
thod of reasoning, you renounce all
claim to infinity in any of the attributes
of the Deity. For as the cause ought
only to be proportioned to the effect;
and the effect, so far as it falls under our
cognisance, is not infinite ; what pre-*
tensions,
Natural Religion. 105
tensions have we, upon your supposi- ^KT
tions, to ascribe that attribute to the di- v-"v~>
vine Being ? You will still insist, that,
by removing him so much from all si
milarity to human creatures, we give
into the most arbitrary hypothesis, and
at the same' time weaken all proofs of
his existence.
Secondly, You have no reason, on your
theory, for ascribing perfection to the
Deity, even in his finite capacity ; or for
supposing him free from every error, mi
stake, or incoherence, in his underta
kings. There are many inexplicable dif
ficulties in the works of Nature, which,
if we allow a perfect author to be proved
a priori, are easily solved, and become
only seeming difficulties, from the nar
row capacity of man, who cannot trace
infinite relations. But according to your
method of reasoning, these difficulties
become all real; and perhaps will be
insisted on, as new instances of likeness

contriving and framing a world ? This
is only so much greater similarity to
human affairs. By sharing the work
among several, we may so much far
ther limit the attributes of each, and get
rid of that extensive power and know
ledge, which must be supposed in one
deity, and which, according to you, can
only serve to weaken the proof of his
existence. And if such foolish, such vi
cious creatures as man can yet often
unite in framing and executing one
plan ; how much more those deities or
dæmons, whom we may suppose several
degrees more perfect?
To multiply causes, without neces

it would be needless, I own, (though not ^^
absurd), to suppose any other deity ex
istent. But while it is still a question,
Whether all these attributes are united
in one subject, or dispersed among se
veral independent beings ; by what phe
nomena in nature can we pretend to de
cide the controversy ? Where we see a
body raised in a scale, we are sure that
there is in the opposite scale, however
concealed from sight, some counterpoi
sing weight equal to it : but it is still al
lowed to doubt, whether that weight
be an aggregate of several distinct bo
dies, or one uniform united mass. And
if the weight requisite very much ex
ceeds any thing which we have ever
seen conjoined in any single body, the
former supposition becomes still more
probable and natural. An intelligent

In a word, Cleanthes, a man, who

universe, sometime, arose from some
thing like design : but beyond that po
sition he cannot ascertain one single cir
cumstance ; and is left afterwards to fix
€very point of his theology, by the ut
most license of fancy and hypothesis.
This world, for aught he knows, is very
faulty and imperfect, compared to a su

rude essay of some infant deity, who af
terwards abandoned it, ashamed of his

of some dependent, inferior deity; and
is the object of derision to his superiors:
it is the production of old age and dotage
in some superannuated deity; and ever
since his death, has run on at adven
tures, from the first impulse and active

have place. And I cannot, for my part,

v^-y^j and unsatisfactory.
To render it still more unsatisfactoryi
said Philo, there occurs to me another
hypothesis, which must acquire an air
of probability from the method of rea
soning so much insisted on by Clean-*
thes. That like effects arise from like
causes : this principle he supposes the
foundation of all religion. But there is
another principle of the same kind, no
less certain, and derived from the same
source of experience ; That where seve
ral known circumstances are observed
to be similar, the unknown will also be
found similar. Thus, if we see the
limbs of a human body, we conclude,
that it is also attended with a human
head, though hid from us. Thus, if
we see, through a chink in a wall, a
small part of the sun, we conclude,
that, were the wall removed, we should
see the whole body. In short, this
method
Natural Religion. 115
t
method of reasoning is so obvious and Part
familiar, that no scruple can ever be
made with regard to its solidity.
Now if we survey the universe, so
far as it falls under our knowledge, it
bears a great resemblance to an animal
or organized body, and seems actuated
with a like principle of life and motion.
A continual circulation of matter in
it produces no disorder : a continual
waste in every part is incessantly re
paired: the closest sympathy is per
ceived throughout the entire system :
and each part or member, in perform
ing its proper offices, operates both to
its own preservation and to that of the
whole. The world, therefore, I infer,
is an animal ; and the Deity is the
SOUL of the world, actuating it, and
actuated by it.
You have too much learning, Cle-
anthes, to be at all surprised at this
opinion,
n6 Dialogues concerning
Tart opinion, which, ycm know, was main-
^-Y-L< tained by almost all the Theists of anti
quity, and chiefly prevails in their dis
courses and reasonings. For though
sometimes the ancient philosophers rea
son from final causes, as if they thought
the world the workmanship of God ;
yet it appears rather their favourite no
tion to consider it as his body, whose
organization tenders it subservient to
him. And it must be confessed, that
as the universe resembles more a human
body than it does the works of human
art and contrivance ; if our limited
analogy could ever, with any propriety,
be extended to the whole of nature, the
inference seems juster in favour of the
ancient than the modern theory.
There are many other advantages,
too, in the former theory, which re
commended it to the ancient Theolo
gians. Nothing more repugnant to all
their notions, because nothing more
repugnant

repugnant to common experience, than Part
mind without body ; a mere spiritual c^-0
substance, which fell not under their
senses nor comprehension, and ofwhich
they had not observed one single in
stance throughout all nature. Mind
and body they knew, because they felt
both : an order, arrangement, organi
zation, or internal machinery, in both,
they likewise knew, after the same man
ner : and it could not but seem reason
able to transfer this experience to the
Universe; and to suppose the divine
mind and body to be also coeval, and
to have, both of them, order and ar
rangement naturally inherent in them,
and inseparable from them.
Here, therefore, is a new species
of Anthropomorphism, Cleanthes, on
which you may deliberate ; and a the

considerable difficulties. You are too

I should not have acted with half that
caution and reserve, in starting objec
tions and difficulties to it. However,
if any thing occur to you, you will

Why then, replied Cleanthes, it
seems to me, that, though the world
does, in many circumstances, resem
ble an animal body ; yet is the analogy
also defective in many circumstances,
the most material : no organs of sense ;
no seat of thought or reason; no one
precise origin of motion and action. In
short, it seems to bear a stronger resem

mal, and your inference would be so

argument to this purpose, which, I be

their inference wants not force, may
perhaps be refuted by considerations
derived from the nature of human so
ciety, which is in continual revolution,
between ignorance and knowledge, li
berty and slavery, riches and poverty;
so that it is impossible for us, from our
limited experience, to foretell with as
surance what events may or may not
be expected. Ancient learning and hi
story seem to have been in great danger
of entirely perishing after the inunda
tion of the barbarous nations ; and had
these convulsions continued a little long
er, or been a little more violent, we

should not probably have now known P**T
what pasted in the world a few centuries
before us. Nay, were it not for the su
perstition of the Popes, who preserved
a little jargon of Latin, in order to
support the appearance of an ancient
and universal church, that tongue must
have been utterly lost : in which case,
the Western world, being totally bar
barous, would not have been in a fit
disposition for receiving the Greek
language and learning, which was con
veyed to them after the sacking of Con
stantinople. When learning and
books had been extinguished, even the
mechanical arts would have fallen con
siderably to decay ; and it is easily ima
gined, that fable or tradition might
ascribe to them a much later origin
than the true one. This vulgar argu
ment, therefore, against the eternity of
the world, seems a little precarious.
But here appears to be the founda-

v^-vO was the first that brought cherry-trees
from Asia to Europe ; though that tree
thrives so well in many European
climates, that it grows in the woods
without any culture. Is it possible, that,
throughout a whole eternity, no Euro
pean had ever passed into Asia, and
thought of transplanting so delicious a
fruit into his own country ? Or if the
tree was once transplanted and propa
gated, how could it ever afterwards pe
rish? Empires may rise and fall; liberty
and slavery succeed alternately ; igno
rance and knowledge' give place to each
other; but the cherry-tree will still re
main in the woods of Greece, Spain,
and Italy, and will never be affected
by the revolutions of human society.

Is it possible, that, during the revolu

have the sense to think of garters to tie
them. All these seem convincing proofs
of the youth, or rather infancy, of the
world ; as being founded on the ope

steady than those by which human so
ciety is governed and directed. No

satisfactory, it is at least a theory that
we must, sooner or later, have recourse

PART

PART VII.
UT here, continued Philo, in ex- Part
amining the ancient system of the «»^w
soul of the world, there strikes me, all
on a sudden, a new idea, which, ifjust,
must go near to subvert all your rea
soning, and destroy even your first in
ferences, on which you repose such con
fidence. If the universe bears a greater
likeness to animal bodies and to vege
tables, than to the works of human art,
it is more probable, that its cause re
sembles the cause of the former than
that of the laeter, and its origin ought
rather to be ascribed to generation or
vegetation than to reason or design.
Your conclusion, even according to your
own
13° Dialogues concerning
Part own principles, is therefore lame and
v^v-o defective.
Pray open up this argument a little
farther, said Demea. For I do not
rightly apprehend it, in that Concise
manner in which you have expressed
it.
Our friend Cle.anthes, replied
Philo, as you have heard, asserts, that
since no question of fact can be proved
otherwise than by experience, the exist
ence of a Deity admits not of proof
from any other medium. The world,
says he, resembles the works of human
contrivance: Therefore its cause must
also resemble that of the other. Here
we may remark, that the operation of
one very small part of nature, to wit
man, upon another very small part, to
wit that inanimate matter lying within
his reach, is the rule by which Clean
thes judges of the origin of the whole;
and
Natural Religion. 131
and he measures objects, so widely dis- Part
proportioned, by the same individual
standard. But to wave all objections
drawn from this topic; I affirm, that
there are other parts of the universe
(besides the machines of human inven
tion) which bear still a greater resem
blance to the fabric of the world, and
which therefore afford a better conjec
ture concerning the universal origin of
this system. These parts are animals
and vegetables. The world plainly re
sembles more an animal or a vegetable,
than it does a watch or a knitting-loom.
Its cause, therefore, it is more probable,
resembles the cause of the former. The
cause of the former is generation or ve
getation. The cause, therefore, of the
world, we may infer to be something si
milar or analogous to generation or ve
getation.
But how is it conceivable, said De-
mea, that the world can arise from any
thing
132 Dialogues concerning
PARr thing similar to vegetation or genera-
<~~v^j tion?
Very easily, replied Philo. In like
manner as a tree sheds its seed into the
neighbouring fields, and produces other
trees ; so the great vegetable, the world,
or this planetary system, produces with
in itself certain seeds, which, being scat*
tered into the surrounding chaos, vege
tate into new worlds. A comet, for in
stance, is the seed of a world ; and after
it has been fully ripened, by passing
from sun to sun, and star to star, it is at
last tossed into the unformed elements
which every where surround this uni
verse, and immediately sprouts up into
a new system.
Or if, for the sake of variety (for I
see no other advantage), we fliould sup
pose this world to be an animal; a co
met is the egg of this animal : and in
like manner as an ostrich lays its egg
in
Natural Religion. 133
«
ill the sand, which, without any far- ?"T
ther care, hatches the egg, and produces «^>-^
a new animal ; so ..... . I understand
you, says Demea : But what wild, ar
bitrary suppositions are these? What
data have you for such extraordinary
conclusions ? And is the slight, imagi
nary resemblance of the world to a ve
getable or an animal sufficient to esta
blish the same inference with regard to
both ? Objects, which are in general so
widely different; ought they to be a
standard for each other ?
Right, cries Philo : This is the
topic on which I have all along insisted;
I have still asserted, that We have no
data to establim any system of cosmo-*
gony. Our experience, so imperfect in
itself, and so limited both in extent and
duration, can afford us no probable
conjecture concerning the whole of
things. But if we must needs fix on
some hypothesis ; by what rule, pray,
I ought
134 Dialogues concerning
Part ought we to determine our choice ? Is
ssvJ there any other rule than the greater
similarity of the objects compared?
And does not a plant or an animal,
which springs from vegetation or gene
ration, bear a stronger resemblance to
the world, than does any artificial ma
chine, which arises from reason and
design ?
But what is this vegetation and
generation of which you talk, said
Demea? Can you explain their opera
tions, and anatomize that fine internal
structure on which they depend ?
As much, at least, replied Philo,
as Cleanthes can explain the opera
tions of reason, or anatomize that in
ternal structure on which it depends.
But without any such elaborate disqui
sitions, when I see an animal, I infer,
that it sprang from generation ; and
that with as great certainty as you con
clude
Natural Religion. 135
elude a house to have been reared by ^TRTT
design. These words, generation, rea
son, mark only certain powers and
energies in nature, whose effects are
known, but whose essence is incompre
hensible ; and one of these principles,
more than the other, has no privilege
for being made a standard to the whole
of nature.
In reality, Demea, it may reason
ably be expected, that the larger the
views are which we take of things, the
better will they conduct us in our con
clusions concerning such extraordinary
and such magnificent subjects. In this
little corner of the world alone, there
are four principles, Reason, InstinB, Ge
neration, Vegetation, which are similar
to each other, and are the causes of si
milar effects. What a number ofother
principles may we naturally suppose in
the immense extent and variety of the
universe, could we travel from planet
, I 2 to
136 Dialogues concerning
Part to planet %and from system to system,
v^r^i in order to examine each part of this
mighty fabric ? Any one of these four
principles above mentioned (and a hun
dred others, which lie open to our con
jecture) may afford us a theory, by
which to judge of the origin of the
world; and it is a palpable and egre
gious partiality, to confine our view
entirely to that principle by which our
own minds operate. Were this prin
ciple more intelligible on that account,
such a partiality might be somewhat
excuseable : But reason, in its internal
fabric and structure, is really as little
known to us as instinct or vegetation ;
and perhaps even that vague, undeter-
minate word, Nature, to which the
vulgar refer every thing, is not at the
bottom more inexplicable. The effects
of these principles are all known to us
from experience: But the principles
themselves, and their manner of opera
tion, are totally unknown : Nor is it less
intelligible,
Natural Religion. 137
intelligible, or less conformable to ex- P**T
perience, to say, that the world arose by o-v-o
vegetation from a seed shed by another
world, than to say that it arose from a
divine reason or contrivance, according
to the sense in which Cleanthes un
derstands it.
But methinks, said Demea, if the
world had a vegetative quality, and
could sow the seeds of new worlds into
the infinite chaos, this power would be
still an additional argument for design
in its author. For whence could arise
so wonderful a faculty but from design ?
Or how can order spring from any
thing which perceives not that order
which it bestows ?
You need only look around you, re-*
plied Philo, to satisfy yourself with
regard to this question. A tree bestows
order and organization on that tree
which springs from it, without know-
I 3 inS
138 Dialogues concerning
^RT ing the order : an animal, in the same
«-^~» manner, on its offspring ; a bird, on
its nest : and instances of this kind are
even more frequent in the world, than
those of order, which arise from reason
and contrivance. To say that all this
order in animals and vegetables proceeds
ultimately from design, is begging the
question : nor can that great point be
ascertained otherwise than by proving,
apriori, .both that order is, from its na
ture, inseparably attached to thought ;
and that it can never, of itself, or from
original unknown principles, belong to
matter.
But farther, Demea; this objection,
which you urge, can never be made
use of by Cleanthes, without re
nouncing a defence which he has al
ready made against one of my objec
tions. When I inquired concerning
the cause of that supreme reason and
intelligence, into which he resolves e~
very

very thing ; he told me, that the im- Part
possibility of satisfying such inquiries ^Xj
could never be admitted as an objec
tion in any species of philosophy. We
mujlJlopsomewhere, says he ; nor is it ever
•within the reach of human capacity to ex
plain ultimate causes, or shonv the last con
nexions of any objects. It is sufficient', if
thejleps, so far as <we go, aresupported by
experience and observation. Now, that
vegetation and generation, as well as
reason, are experienced to be principles
of order in nature, is undeniable. If
I rest my system of cosmogony on. the
former, preferably to the latter, it is at
my choice. The matter seems entirely
arbitrary. And when Cleanthes asks
me what is the cause of my great vege
tative or generative faculty, I am equal
ly intitled to ask him the cause of his
great reasoning principle. These que-
stions we have agreed to forbear on
both fides ; and it is chiefly his interest
on the present occasion to stick to this
I 4 agree-
140 Dialogues concerning
vV/ agreement. Judging by our limited
y-rv*> and imperfect experience, generation
has some privileges above reason : For
We see every day the latter arise from
the former, never the former from the
latter.
Compare, I beseech you, the conse
quences on both sides. The world, say
I, resembles an animal ; therefore it is
an animal, therefore it arose from gene
ration. The steps, I confess, are wide;
yet there is some small appearance of
analogy in each step. The world, says
Cleanthes, resembles a machine;
therefore it is a machine, therefore it
arose from design. The steps here are
equally wide, and the analogy less stri
king. And if he pretends to carry on
my hypothesis a step farther, and to in
fer design or reason from the great prin
ciple of generation, on which I insist ;
I may, with better authority, use the
same freedom to push farther his hy
pothesis,

pothefis, and infer a divine generation Part
or theogeny from his principle of rea- v^v^»
son. I have at least some faint sliadow
of experience, which is the utmost that
can ever be attained in the present sub
ject. Reason, in innumerable instances,
is observed to arise from the principle
of generation, and never to arise from
any other principle.
Hesiod, and all the ancient Mytho-
logists, were so struck with this analogy,
that they universally explained the ori
gin of nature from an animal birth, and
copulation. Plato too, so far as he is
intelligible, seems to have adopted some
such notion in his Timæus,
The Bramins assert, that the world
arose from an infinite spider, who spun
this whole complicated mass from his
bowels, and annihilates afterwards the
whole or any part of it, by absorbing
it again, and resolving it into his own
essence.

i^rJ which appears to us ridiculous ; because
a spider is a little contemptible animal,
whose operations we are never likely to

But still here is a new species of analogy,
even in our globe. And were there a
planet wholly inhabited by spiders,
(which is very possible), this inference
would there appear as natural and irre

"TT7HAT you ascribe to the fertility ™rT
Par
of my invention, replied Philo,
is entirely owing to the nature of the
subject. In subjects, adapted to the nar
row compass of human reason, there is
commonlybut one determination,which
carries probability or conviction with
it; and to a man of sound judgment,
all other suppositions, but that one, ap
pear entirely absurd and chimerical.
But in such questions as the present, a
hundred contradictory views may pre
serve a kind of imperfect analogy ; and
invention has here full scope to ex
ert itself. Without any great effort of
thought, I believe that I could, in an in
stant,
146 Dialogues concerning
Part ftant, propose other systems of cosmo-
v>rvJ gony, which would have some faint ap
pearance of truth ; though it is a thou
sand, a million to one, ifeither yours or
any one of mine be the true system.
For instance ; what ifI should revive
the old Epicurean hypothesis ? This
is commonly, and I believe justly, e-
steemed the most absurd system that
has yet been proposed ; yet, I know not,
whether, with a few alterations, it might
not be brought to bear a faint appear
ance of probability. Instead of suppo
sing matter infinite, as Epicurus did;
let us suppose it finite. A finite num
ber of particles is only susceptible of fi
nite transpositions : and it must happen,
in an eternal duration, that every pos
sible order or position must be tried an
infinite number of times. This world,
therefore, with all its events, even the
most minute, has before been produced
and destroyed, and will again be produ

ced and destroyed, without any bounds Part
and limitations. No one, who has a con- »-^rJ
ception of the powers ofinfinite, in com
parison of finite, will ever scruple this
determination.
But this supposes, said Demea, that
matter can acquire motion, without any
voluntary agent or first mover.
And where is the difficulty, replied
Philo, ofthat supposition? Every event,
before experience, is equally difficult
and incomprehensible ; and every event,
after experience, is equally easy and in
telligible. Motion, in many instances,
from gravity, from elasticity, from e-
lectricity, begins in matter, without any
known voluntary agent: and to sup
pose always, in these cases, an unknown
voluntary agent, is mere hypothesis ;
and hypothesis attended with no advan
tages. The beginning of motion in
matter itself is as conceivable a priori as
its
148 Dialogues concerning
£Ta"" its communication from mind and in-
»^w telhgence.
'
Besides ; why may not motion have
been propagated by impulse through all
eternity; and the same stock of it, or
nearly the same, be still upheld in the
universe? As much as is lost by the
composition of motion, as much is gain
ed by its resolution. And whatever the
causes are, the fact is certain, that mat
ter is, and always has been, in continual
agitation, as far as human experience or
tradition reaches. There is not proba
bly, at present, in the whole universe,
one particle of matter at absolute rest.
And this very consideration too, con-
, tinued Philo, which we have stumbled
on in the course of the argument, sug
gests a new hypothesis of cosmogony,
that is not absolutely absurd and im
probable. Is there a system, an order,
an œconomy of things, by which mat
ter

ter can preserve that perpetual agita- V1II
tion which seems essential to it, and
yet maintain a constancy in the forms
which it produces? There certainly is
such an œconomy : for this is actually
the case with the present world. The
continual motion of matter, therefore,
in less than infinite transpositions, must
produce this ceconomy or order; and
by its very nature, that order, when once
established, supports itself, for many
ages, if not to eternity. But where-
ever matter is so poized, arranged, and
adjusted, as to continue in perpetual mo
tion, and yet preserve a constancy in the
forms, its situation must, of necessity,
have all the same appearance of art and
contrivance which we observe at pre
sent. All the parts of each form must
have a relation to each other, and to the
whole : and the whole itself must have
a relation to the other parts of the uni
verse; to the element, in which the
form subsists ; to the materials, with
K which
150 Dialogues concerning

\<-v^ and to every other form, which is ho
stile or friendly. A defect in any of
these particulars destroys the form ; and
thé matter, of which it is composed, is
again set loose, and is thrown into irre
gular motions and fermentations, till it
unite itself to some other regular form.
If no such form be prepared to receive
it, and if there be a great quantity of
this corrupted matter in the universe,
the universe itself is entirely disordered;
whether it be the feeble embryo of a
world in its first beginnings that is thus
destroyed, or the rotten carcase of one
languishing in old age and infirmity. In
either case, a chaos ensues; till finite,
though innumerable revolutions pro

and organs are so adjusted as to support
the forms amidst a continued succes

Suppose, (forwefhallendeavourtovary

into any position, by a blind, unguided <-*v>-f
force; it is evident, that this first posi
tion must in all probability be the most
confused and most disorderly imagin
able, without any resemblance to those
works of human contrivance, which, a-
long with a symmetry of parts, discover
an adjustment of means to ends, and a
tendency to self-preservation. If the ac
tuating force cease after this operation,
matter must remain for ever in disorder,
and continue an immense chaos, with
out any proportion or activity. But
suppose, that the actuating force, what
ever it be, still continues in matter, this
first position will immediately give place
to a second, which will likewise in all
probability be as disorderly as the first,
and so on through many successions of
changes and revolutions. No particular
order or position ever continues a mo
ment unaltered. The original force,
still remaining in activity, gives a per-

«-v^« sible situation is produced, and instantly
destroyed. Isa glimpse or dawn of or
der appears for a moment, it is instantly
hurried away, and confounded, by that
never-ceasing force which actuates e-
very part of matter.
Thus the universe goes on for many
ages in a continued succession of chaos
and disorder. But is it not possible that
it may settle at last, so as not to lose its
motion and active force (for- that we
have supposed inherent in it), yet so as
to preserve an uniformity of appearance,
amidst the continual motion artd fluc
tuation of its parts ? This we find to be
the case with the universe at present.
Every individual is perpetually chan
ging, and every part of every indivi
dual; and yet the whole remains, in ap
pearance, the same. May we not hope
for such a position, or rather be assured
of it, from the eternal revolutions of
unguided
Natural Religion. 153
unguided matter ; and may not this ac- ?*.*.*
count for all the appearing wisdom and »^r>>
contrivance which is in the universe ?
Let us contemplate the subject a little,
and we mail find, that this adjustment,
if attained by matter, of a seeming sta
bility in the forms, with a real and per
petual revolution or motion of parts,
affords a plausible, if not a true solution
of the difficulty.
It is in vain, therefore, to insist upon
the uses of the parts in animals or ve
getables, and their curious adjustment
to each other. I would fain know, how
an animal could subsist, unless its parts
were so adjusted ? Do we not find, that
it immediately perishes whenever this
adjustment ceases, and that its matter
corrupting tries some new form ? It hap
pens, indeed, that the parts of the world
are so well adjusted, that some regular
form immediately lays claim to this cor
rupted matter: and if it were not so,
K 3 could
154 Dialogues concerning

u-^J dissolve as well as the animal, and pass
through new positions and situations;
till in a great, but finite succession, it
fall at last into the present or some such
order?
It is well, replied Cleanthes, you
told us, that this hypothesis was sug
gested on a sudden, in the course of the
argument. Had you had leisure to ex
amine it, you would soon have percei
ved the insuperable objections to which
it is exposed. No form, you say, can
subsist, unless it possess those powers and
organs requisite for its subsistence : some
new order or œconomy must be tried^
and so on, without intermission ; till at
last some order, which can support and
maintain itself, is fallen upon. But ac
cording to this hypothesis, whence arise
the many conveniencies and advantages
which men and all animals possess ? Two

Arabia, would the world have been
dissolved? If no loadstone had been fra
med to give that wonderful and useful
direction to the needle, would human
society and the human kind have been
immediately extinguished ? Though the
maxims of Nature be in general very
frugal, yet instances of this kind are far
from being rare; and any one of them
is a sufficient proof of design, and of a
benevolent design, which gave rise to
the order and arrangement of the uni

here our only reasonable resource. And

T>UT if so many difficulties attend the raRT
argument a posteriori, saidDEMEA; ^w
had we not better adhere to that simple
and sublime argument a priori, which,
by offering to us infallible demonstra
tion, cuts off at once all doubt and dif
ficulty? By this argument* too, we may
prove the INFINITY of the divine at
tributes ; which, I am afraid, can never
be ascertained with certainty from any
other topic. For how can an effect,
which either is finite, or, for aught we
know, may be so; how can such an ef
fect, I say, prove an infinite cause ? The
unity too of the Divine Nature, it is
very difficult, if not absolutely impos
sible,
160 Dialogues concerning

v^v-v plating the works of nature; nor will

were it allowed, give us any assurance of
that attribute. Whereas the argument
a priori .....
You seem to reason, Demea, inter
posed Cleanthfs, as if those advan
tages and conveniencies in the abstract
argument were full proofs ofits solidity.
But it is first proper, in my opinion, to
determine what argument of this na
ture you choose to insist on ; and we
shall afterwards, from itself, better than
4 from its useful consequences, endeavour
to determine what value we ought to
put upon it.
The argument,repliedDemea, which '
I would insist on, is the common one.
Whatever exists, must have a cause or
reason of its existence ; it being abso
lutely impossible for any thing to pro
duce
Natural Religion. 161
duce itself, or be the cause of its own Part
existence. In mounting up, therefore, u^
from effects to causes, we must either
go on in tracing an infinite succession,
without any ultimate cause at all ; or
must atjast have recourse to some ulti
mate cause, that is necessarily existent:
Now that the first supposition is absurd,
may be thus proved. In the infinite
chain or succession of causes and effects,
each single effect is determined to exist
by the power and efficacy of that cause
which immediately preceded ; but the
whole eternal chain or succession, taken
together, is not determined or caused
by any thing ; and yet it is evident
that it requires a cause or reason, aa
much as any particular object which
begins to exist in time. The question
is still reasonable, Why this particular
succession of causes existed from eterni
ty, and not any other succession, or no
succession at all. If there be no ne
cessarily-existent being, any supposition
which
1 62 Dialogues concerning
Pa*?t which can be formed is equally pos-
^yrii fible ; nor is there any more absurdity
in Nothing's having existed from eter
nity, than there is in that succession
of causes which constitutes the uni
verse. What was it, then, which de
termined Something to exist rather than
Nothing, and bestowed being on a par
ticular possibility, exclusive of the rest J
External causes', there are supposed to be
none. Chance is a word without a
meaning. Was it Nothing? But that
can never produce any thing. We
must, therefore, have recourse to a ne
cessarily-existent Being, who carries the
REASON of his existence in himself;
and who cannot be supposed not to
exist, without an express contradiction.
There is consequently such a Being ;
that is, there is a Deity.
I shall not leave it to Philo, said
Cleanthes, (though I know that the
starting objections is his chief delight)
to
Natural Religion. 163
to point out the weakness of this meta- p**t
physical reasoning. It seems to me so ^^
obviously ill-grounded, and at the same
time of so little consequence to the
cause of true piety and religion, that I
shall myself venttire to show the fallacy
of it.
I shall begin with observing, that
there is an evident absurdity in pretend
ing to demonstrate a matter of fact, or
to prove it by any arguments a priori.
Nothing is demonstrable, unless the
contrary implies a contradiction. No
thing, that is distinctly conceivable, im
plies a contradiction. Whatever we
condeive as existent, we can also con
ceive as non-existent. There is no
being, therefore, whose non-existence
implies a contradiction. Consequently
there is no being, whose existence is
demonstrable. I propose this argument
as entirely decisive, and am willing to
rest the whole controversy upon it.
It
164 Dialogues concerning
Part Xt is pretended that the Deity is a
^v-J necessarily-existent being; and this ne
cessity of his existence is attempted to be
explained by asserting, that, ifwe knew
his whole essence or nature, we should
perceive it to be as impossible for him
not to exist as for twice, two not to be
four.' But it is evident, that this can
never happen, while our faculties re
main the same as at presentL It will
still be possible for us, at any time, to
conceive the non-existence of what we
formerly conceived to exist; nor can
the mind ever lie under a necessity of
supposing any object to remain always
in being; in the same manner"as we lie
under a necessity of always conceiving
twice two to be four. The words,
therefore, necessary existence, have no
meaning; or, which is the same thing,
none that is consistent.
But farther: Why may not the ma
terial universe be the necessarily-exis
tent

tent Being, acording to this pretended Part
explication of necessity? We dare not «—v^»
affirm that we know all the qualities of
matter ; and for aught we can deter
mine, it may contain some qualities,
which, were they known, would make
its non-existence appear as great a con
tradiction as that twice two is five. I
find only one argument employed to
prove, that the material world is not
the necessarily-existent Being ; and this
argument is derived from the contin
gency both of the matter and the form
of the world. " Any particle of mat
ter," it is said *, " may be conceived to
w be annihilated ; and any form may
*c be conceived to be altered. Such an
" annihilation or alteration, therefore,
** is not impossible." But it seems a
great partiality not to perceive, that the
same argument extends equally to the
Deity, so far as we have any concep
tion of him ; and that the mind can at
L least

i66 Dialogues concerning
Part least imagine him to be non-existent,
or his attributes to be altered. It must
be some unknown, inconceivable qua
lities, which can make his non-exis
tence appear impossible, or his attri
butes unalterable: And no reason can
be assigned, why these qualities may
not belong to matter. As they are al
together unknown and inconceivable,
they can never be proved incompatible
with it.
Add to this, that in tracing an eter
nal succession of objects, it seems ab
surd to inquire for a general cause or
first author. How can any thing, that
exists from eternity, have a cause; since
that relation implies a priority in time,
and a beginning of existence ?
In such a chain, too, or succession of
objects, each part is caused by that
which preceded it, and causes that
which succeeds it. Where then is the
difficulty ?
Natural Religion. 167
difficulty ? But the WHOLE, you say, P«T
wants a cause. I answer, that the uni
ting of these parts into a whole, like the
uniting of several distinct counties into
one kingdom, or several distinct mem
bers into one body, is performed mere
ly by an arbitrary act of the mind, and
has no influence on the nature of things.
Did I show you the particular causes of
each individual in a collection of twenty
particles of matter, I should think it
very unreasonable, mould you after
wards ask me, what was the cause ofthe
whole twenty. That is sufficiently ex
plained in explaining the cause of the
parts.
Though the reasonings which you
have urged, Cleanthes, may well
excuse me, said Philo, from starting
any farther difficulties ; yet I Cannot
forbear insisting still upon another to
pic. It is observed by arithmeticians,
that the products of 9 compose always
L 3 either
1 68 Dialogues concerning
Part either 9, or some lesser product of 9 ; if
c-v^ you add together all the characters, of
which any of the former products is
composed. Thus, of 18, 27, 36, which
are products of 9, you make 9 by ad
ding 1 to 8, 2 to 7, 3 to 6. Thus, of
369 is a product also of 9 ; and if you
add 3, 6, and 9, you make 18, a lesser
product of 9 *. To a superficial ob
server, so wonderful a regularity may
be admired as the effect either of chance
or design : but a skilful algebraist im
mediately concludes it to be the work
of necessity ; and demonstrates, that it
must for ever result from the nature of
these numbers. Is it not probable, I
ask, that the whole œconomy of the
universe is conducted by a like neces
sity, though no human algebra can
furnish a key which solves the difficul
ty? And instead of admiring the order
of natural beings, may it not happen,
that, could we penetrate into the inti

they could ever admit of any other dis
position? So dangerous is it to intro
duce this idea of necessity into the pre
sent question ! and so naturally does it
afford an inference directly opposite to
the religious hypothesis !
But dropping all these abstractions,
continued Philo ; and confining our
selves to more familiar topics ; I shall
venture to add an observation, that the
argument a priori has seldom been
found very convincing, except to peo
ple of a metaphysical head, who have
accustomed themselves to abstract rea
soning, and who finding from mathe
matics, that the understanding fre
quently leads to truth, through ob
scurity, and contrary to first appearT
ances, have transferred the same habit
of thinking to subjects where it ou,eht

some methods of atonement, and ap

I am indeed persuaded, said Philo,
that the best, and indeed the only,
method of bringing every one to a due
sense of religion, is by just representa
tions of the misery and wickedness of
men. And for that purpose a talent of
eloquence and strong imagery is more
requisite than that of reasoning and ar
gument. For is it necessary to prove,
what every one feels within himself?
It is only necessary to make us feel it,
if possible, more intimately and sen*
sibly.
The people, indeed, replied Demea,
are sufficiently. convinced of this great
and melancholy truth. The miseries
of

of life ; the unhappiness of man ; the P*"
general corruptions of our nature ; the
unsatisfactory enjoyment of pleasures,
riches, honours ; these phrases have
become almost proverbial in all lan
guages. And who can doubt of what
all men declare from their own imme
diate feeling and exerience ?
In this point, said Philo, the learn
ed are perfectly agreed with the vulgar;
and in all letters, sacred and profane^
the topic of human misery has been in
sisted on with the most pathetic elo
quence that sorrow and melancholy
could inspire. The poets, who speak
from sentiment, without a system, and
whose testimony has therefore the more
authority, abound in images of this
nature. From Homer down to Dr
Young, the whole inspired tribe have
ever been sensible, that no other re
presentation of tilings would suit the
feeling
174 Dialogues concerning
Part feeling and observation of each indivi

As to authorities, replied Demea,
you need not seek them. Look round
this library of Cleanthes. I shall
venture to affirm, that, except authors
of particular sciences, such as chy-
mistry or botany, who have no occasion
to treat of human life, there is scarce
one of those innumerable writers, from
whom the sense of human misery has
not, in some passage or other, extorted
a complaint and confession of it. At
least, the chance is entirely on that
side ; and no one author has ever, so
far as I can recollect, been so extrava
gant as to deny it.
There you must excuse me, said
Philo: Leibnitz has denied it; and
is perhaps the first * who ventured

upon so bold and paradoxical an opi- Part
nion ; at least, the first who. made it \^j
essential to his philosophical system.
And by being the first, replied De
rie A, might he not have been sensible
»of his error ? For is this a subject in
which philosophers can propose to
make discoveries, especially in so late
an age ? And can any man hope by a
simple denial (for the subject scarcely
admits of reasoning) to bear down the
united testimony of mankind, founded
on sense and consciousness ?
And why should man, added he,
pretend to an exemption from the lot
of all other animals ? The whole earth,
believe me, Philo, is cursed and pol
luted. A perpetual war is kindled a-
mongst all living creatures. Necessity,
hunger, want, stimulate the strong and
courageous : Fear, anxiety, terror, a-
gitate the weak and infirm. The first

Observe too, says Philo, the cu
rious artifices of Nature in order to
embitter the life of every living being.
The stronger prey upon the weaker,
and keep them in perpetual terror and
anxiety. The weaker too, in their
turn, often prey upon the stronger,
and vex and molest them without re
laxation. Consider that innumerable
race of insects, which either are bred on
the body ofeach animal, or flying about
infix their stings in him. These insects
have others still less than themselves,
which torment them. And thus on

For by combination in society, he can
easily mailer lions, tygers, and bears,
whose greater strength and agility na
turally enable them to prey upon him.
On the contrary, it is here chiefly,
cried Philo, that the uniform and
equal maxims of Nature are most ap
parent. Man, it is true, can, by com
bination, surmount all his realenemies,
and become master of the whole ani
mal creation : but does he not immedi
ately raise up to himself imaginary ene
mies, the dæmons of his fancy, who
haunt him with superstitious terrors,
and blast every enjoyment of life? His
pleasure, as he imagines, becomes, in
their eyes, a crime: his food and repose
give them umbrage and offence: his
very sleep and dreams furnish new ma

his refuge from every other ill, presents
only
178 Dialogues concerning

There is no evading such striking
instances, said Philo, but by apologies,
which still farther aggravate the charge.
Why have all men, I aslc, in all ages,
complained incessantly of the miseries
of life ? They have no just reason,
says one : these complaints proceed only
from their discontented, repining, anxi

temper?
But if they were really as unhappy

ashamed to vent their complaints in the

to the great, the fortunate emperor,
Charles V. -when, tired with human
grandeur, he resigned all his extensive
dominions into the hands of his son. In
the last harangue, which he made on
that memorable occasion, he publicly
avowed, that tfe greatest prosperities
which he had ever enjoyed, had been mixed

And is it possible, Cleanthes, said
Philo, that after all these reflections,
and infinitely more, which might be
suggested, you can still persevere in
your Anthropomorphism, and assert the
moral attributes of the Deity, his ju
stice, benevolence, mercy, and recti
tude, to be of the same nature with
these virtues in human creatures ? His
power we allow infinite : whatever he
wills is executed : but neither man nor
any other animal is happy : therefore
he does not will their happiness. His
wiftlom is infinite : he is never mistaken

You ascribe, Cleanthes, (and I
believe justly) a purpose and intention
to Nature. But what, I beseech you,
is the object of that curious artifice and
machinery,

machinery, which she has displayed in P**T
all animals I The preservation alone ^n^
of individuals, and propagation of the
species. It seems enough for her ptir-
pose, if such a rank be barely upheld in
the universe, without any care or con
cern for the happiness of the members
that compose it. No resource for this
purpose : no machinery, in order mere
ly to give pleasure or ease : no fund of
pure joy and contentment : no indul
gence, without some want or necessity
accompanying it. At least, the few
phenomena of this nature are over
balanced by opposite phenomena ofstill
greater importance.
Our sense of music, harmony, and
indeed beauty of all kinds, gives satis

tfhen does the divine benevolence dis
play itself, in the sense of you An-
thropomorphites ? None but we Mys
tics, as you were pleased to call us, can
account for this strange mixture of
phenomena, by deriving it from attri
butes, infinitely perfect, but incompre
hensible.
And have you at last, said Clean- .
THES smiling, betrayed your inten
tions, Philo? Your long agreement
with Demea did indeed a little surprise
me ; but I find you were all the while
erecting a concealed battery against me.
And I must confess, that you have now
fallen upon a subject worthy of your

noble spirit of opposition and contro- Part

point, and prove mankind to be un
happy or corrupted, there is an end at
once of all religion. For to what pur
pose establish the natural attributes of
the Deity, while the moral are still
doubtful and uncertain ?
You take umbrage very easily, re
plied Demea, at opinions the most in
nocent, and the most generally received
even amongst the religious and devout
themselves : and nothing can be more
surprising than to find a topic like this,
concerning the wickedness and misery
of man, charged with no less than
Atheism and profaneness. Have not all
pious divines and preachers, who have
indulged their rhetoric on so fertile a
subject; have they not easily, I say,
given a solution of any difficulties
which may attend it ? This world is
but a point in comparison of the
universe ;
iqo Dialogues concerning
Part unversc : this life but a moment in

s^j comparison of eternity. The present
evil phenomena, therefore, are rec
tified in other regions, and in some
future period of existence. And the
eyes of men, being then opened to
larger views of things, see the whole
connection of general laws ; and trace,
with adoration, the benevolence and
rectitude of the Deity, through all' the
mazes and intricacies ofhis providence.
No ! replied Cleanthes, No! These
arbitrary suppositions can never be ad
mitted, contrary to matter of fact, vi
sible and uncontroverted. Whence can
any cause be known but from its known
effects ? Whence can any hypothesis be
proved but from the apparent pheno
mena ? To establish one hypothesis up
on another, is building entirely in the
air ; and the utmost we ever attain, by
these conjectures and fictions, is to as
certain the bare possibility of our opi

nion ; but never can we, upon such Part
terms, establish its reality. v^w
The only method of supporting di
vine benevolence (and it is what I will
ingly embrace) is to deny absolutely
the misery and wickedness of man.
Your representations are exaggerated;
your melancholy views mostly ficti
tious ; your inferences contrary to fact
and experience. Health is more com
mon than sickness ; pleasure than pain ;
happiness than misery. And for one
vexation which we meet with, we at
tain, upon computation, a hundred en
joyments.
Admitting your position, replied
Philo, which yet is extremely doubt
ful ; you must, at the same time, allow,
that, if pain be less frequent than plea
sure, it is infinitely more violent and
durable. One hour of it is often able
' io outweigh a day, a week, a month of
our
192 Dialogues concerning
Part our common insipid enjoyments: And
*^r>j how many days, weeks, and months, are
passed by several in the most acute tor
ments ? Pleasure, scarcely in one in
stance, is ever able to reach ecstasy and
rapture: And in no one instance can it
continue for any time at its highest pitch
and altitude. The spirits evaporate ; the
nerves relax ; the fabric is disordered ;
and the enjoyment quickly degenerates
into fatigue and uneasiness. But pain
often, good God, how often! rises to
torture and agony; and the longer it
continues, it becomes still more genuine
agony and torture. Patience is exhaust
ed ; courage languishes ; melancholy
seizes us ; and nothing terminates our
misery but the removal of its cause, or
another event, which is the sole cure of
all evil, but which, from our natural
folly, we regard with still greater hor
ror and consternation.
But not to insist upon these topics,

continued Phi lo, though most obvious, Part
certain, and important; I must use the ^r^>
freedom to admonish you, Cleanthes,
that you have put the controversy upon
a most dangerous issue, and are unawares
introducing a total Scepticism into the
most essential articles of natural and re
vealed theology. What ! no method of
fixing a just foundation for religion,
unless we allow the happiness of human
life, and maintain a continued existence
even in this world, with all our present
pains, infirmities, vexations, and follies,
to be eligible and desirable ! But this is
contrary to every one's feeling and ex
perience: It is contrary to an authority
so established as nothing can subvert :
No decisive proofs can ever be produced
against this authority ; noris it possible
for you to compute, estimate, and com
pare, all the pains and all the pleasures
in the lives of all men and of all ani
mals : And thus by your resting the
whole system of religion on a point,
t ... which,
194 Dialogues concerning
Part which, from its very nature, must for
^~ ever be uncertain, you tacitly confess,
that that system is equally uncertain.
But allowing you, what never will
be believed; at least, what you never
possibly can prove; that animal, or at
least human happiness, in tins life, ex
ceeds its misery ; you have yet done
nothing : For this is not, by any means,
what we expect from infinite power,
infinite wi£dom, and infinite goodness,
Why is there any misery at all in the"
world ? Not- by chance surely. From
some cause then. Is it from the inten
tion of the Deity ? But he is perfectly
benevolent. Is it contrary to his inten
tion? But he is almighty. Nothing can
fliake the solidity of this reasoning, so
short, so clear, so decisive: except we
assert, that these subjects exceed all hu
man capacity, and that our common
measures of truth and falsehood are not
applicable to them ; a topic, which I
have
Natural Religion. 195
have all along insisted on, but which ?***
you have from the beginning rejected i^v^i
with scorn and indignation.
But I will be contented to retire still
from this intrenchment, for I deny that
you can ever force me in it: I will al
low, that pain or misery in man is com
patible with infinite power and good
ness in the Deity, even in your fense of
these attributes : What are you advan
ced by all these concessions ? A mere pos
sible compatibility is not sufficient. You
must prove these pure, unmixt, and un
controllable attributes from the present
mixt and confused phenomena, and
from these alone. A hopeful underta
king ! Were the phenomena ever so pure
and unmixt, yet being finite, they would
be insufficient for that purpose. How
much more, where they are also so jar
ring and discordant?
Here, Cleanthes, I find myself at
ease
196 Dialogues concerning
PARt ease in my argument. Here I triumph.
Formerly, when we argued concerning
the natural attributes of intelligence and
design, I needed all my sceptical and
metaphysical subtilty to elude your
grasp. In many views of the universe,
and of its parts, particularly the latter,
the beauty and fitness of final causes
strike us with such irresistible force, that
all objections appear {what I believe
they really are) mere cavils and so
phisms; nor can we then imagine how
it was ever possible for us to repose any
weight on them. But there is no view
of human life, or of the condition of
mankind, from which, without the
greatest violence, we can infer the mo
ral attributes, or learn that infinite be
nevolence, conjoined with infinite power
and infinite wisdom, which we must
discover by the eyes of faith alone. , It
is your turn now to tug the labouring
oar, and to support your philosophical
subtilties against the dictates of plain
reason and experience.

N ia
198 Dialogues concerning
T**T in the present subject, if we abandon
all human analogy, as seems your inten
tion, Demea, I am afraid we abandon
all religion, and retain no conception of
the great object of our adoration. If we
preserve human analogy, we must for
ever find it impossible to reconcile any
mixture of evil in the universe with in
finite attributes; much less, can we ever
prove the latter from the former. But
supposing the Author of Nature to be
finitely perfect, though far exceeding
mankind ; a satisfactory account may
then be given of natural and moral evil,
and every untoward,phenomenon be ex
plained and adjusted. A less evil may
then be chosen, in order to avoid a
greater: Inconveniencies be submitted
to, in order to reach a desirable end:
And in a word, benevolence, regulated
by wisdom, and limited by necessity,
may produce just such a world as the
present. You, Philo, who are so prompt
at starting views, and reflections, and
analogies ;
Natural Religion 199
analogies; I would gladly hearj at length, ^£*"r
without interruption, your opinion of
this new theory ; and if it deserve our
attention, we may afterwards, at more
leisure, reduce it into form.
My sentiments, replied Philo, are
not worth being made a mystery of j
and therefore, without any ceremony, I
shall deliver what occurs to me with
regard to the present subject. It must,
I think, be allowed, that, if a very li
mited intelligence, whom we mall sup
pose utterly unacquainted with the uni
verse, were assured, that it were the
production of a very good, wise, and
powerful Being, however finite, he
would, from his Conjectures, form be
forehand a different notion of it from
what we find it to be by experience ;
nor would he ever imagine, merely
from these attributes of the cause, of
which he is informed, that the effect
could be so full of vice and misery and
N a disorder,
200 Dialogues concerning
Part disorder, as it appears in this life. Sup-
wo posing now, that this person were
brought into the world, still assured
that it was the workmanship of such a
sublime and benevolent Being; he
might, perhaps, be surprised at the dis
appointment ; but would never retract
his former belief, if founded on any
very solid argument ; since such a li
mited intelligence must be sensible of
his own blindness and ignorance, and
must allow, that there may be many
solutions of those phenomena, which
will for ever escape his comprehension.
But supposing, which is the real cafe
with regard to man, that this creature
is not antecedently convinced of a
supreme intelligence, benevolent, and
powerful, but is left to gather such a
belief from the appearances of things;
this entirely alters the case, nor will he
ever find any reason for such a conclu
sion. He may be fully convinced of
the narrow limits ofhis understanding ;
but
Natural Religion. 201
but this will not help him in forming P**T
an inference concerning the goodness <~~*~~>
of superior powers, since he must form
that inference from what he knows,
not from what he is ignorant of. The
more you exaggerate his weakness and
ignorance, the more diffident you ren
der him, and give him the greater suspi
cion that such subjects are beyond the
reach of his faculties. You are obliged,
therefore, to reason with him merely
from the known phenomena, and to
drop every arbitrary supposition or con
jecture.
Did I show you a house or palace,
where there was not one apartment
convenient or agreeable; where the
windows, doors, fires, passages, stairs,
and the whole œconomy of the build
ing, were the source of noise, confu
sion, fatigue, darkness, and the ex
tremes of heat and cold; you would
certainly blame the contrivance, with-
N 3 out
202 Dialogues concerning
Part q^ any farther examination. The ar-
ww chitect would in vain display his sub-
tilty, and prove to you, that if this
door or that window were altered,
greater ills would ensue. What he says
may be strictly true : The alteration of
one particular, while the other parts of
the building remain, may only augment
the inconveniencies. But still you would
assert in general, that, if the archi
tect had had skill and good intentions,
he might have formed such a plan of
the whole, and might have adjusted the
parts in such a manner, as would have
remedied all or most of these incon-
veniencies. His ignorance, or even
your own ignorance of such a plan,
will never convince you of the impossi
bility of it. If you find many incon-
veniencies and deformities in the build
ing, you will always, without entering
into any detail, condemn the archi
tect.
In
Natural Religictn. 103
In short, I repeat the question: Is Pa*t
the world, considered in general, and «-^~#
as it appears to us in this life, different
from what a man, or such a limited
being, would, beforehand, expect from
a very powerful, wise, and benevolent
Deity ? It must be strange prejudice to
assert the contrary. And from thence
I conclude, that, however consistent the
world may be, allowing certain suppo
sitions and conjectures, with the idea
of such a Deity, it can never afford us
an inference concerning his existence.
The consistence is not absolutely denied,
only the inference. Conjectures, espe
cially where infinity is excluded from
the divine attributes, may, perhaps, be
sufficient to prove a consistence ; but
can never be foundations for any in
ference.
There seem to hefour circumstances,
on which depend all, or the greatest
part of the ills, that molest sensible
N 4 creatures;
«©4 Dialogues concerning
**" creatures ; and it is not impossible but
v^rv all these circumstances may be necessary
and unavoidable. We know so little be
yond common life, or even of common
life, that, with regard to the œconomy
of a universe, there is no conjecture,
however wild, which may not be just ;
nor any one, however plausible, which
may not be erroneous. All that be
longs to human understanding, in this
deep ignorance and obscurity, is to be
sceptical, or at least cautious ; and not
to admit of any hypothesis whatever;
much less, of any which is supported
by no appearance of probability. Now
this I assert to be the case with regard
to all the causes of evil, and the cir
cumstances on which it depends. None
of them appear to human reason, in
the least degree, necessary or unar
voidable; nor can we suppose them
such, without the utmost license of
imagination,
The,
Natural Religion. 105
The first circumstance which intro- pA"
. . . XI.
duces evil, is that contrivance or ceco- on*-L»
nomy of the animal creation, by which
pains, as well as pleasures, are employ
ed to excite all creatures to action, and
make them vigilant in the great work of
self-preservation. Now pleasure alone,
in its various degrees, seems to human
understanding sufficient for this pur
pose. All animals might be constantly
in a state of enjoyment: but when
urged by any of the necessities of na
ture, such as thirst, hunger, weari
ness ; instead of pain, they might feel
a diminution of pleasure, by which
they might be prompted to seek that
object which is necessary to their sub
sistence. Men pursue pleasure as eager
ly as they avoid pain ; at least, might
have been so constituted. It seems,
therefore, plainly possible to carry on
the business of life without any pain.
Why then is any animal ever rendered
susceptible of such a sensation ? If ani
mals
206 Dialogues concerning
Part mals can be free from it an hour, they
might enjoy a perpetual exemption from
it ; and it required as particular a con
trivance of their organs to produce that
feeling, as to endow them with sight,
hearing, or any of the senses. Shall
we conjecture, that such a contrivance
was necessary, without any appearance
of reason ? and shall we build on that
conjecture, as on the most certain
truth?
But a capacity of pain would not
alone produce pain, were it not for the
second circumstance, viz. the conduct
ing of the world by general laws ; and
this seems nowise necessary to a very
perfect Being. It is true ; if every
thing were conducted by particular
volitions, the course of nature would
be perpetually broken, and no man
could employ his reason in the conduct
of life. But might not other parti
cular volitions remedy this inconveni
ence?
.•..

ence ? . In short, might not the Deity P*"
exterminate all ill, where-ever it were ^^,
to be found ; and produce all good,
without any preparation or long pro
gress of causes and effects ?
Besides, we must: consider, that,
according to the present œconomy of
the world, the course ofNature, though
supposed exactly regular, yet to us ap
pears not so, and many events are un
certain, and many disappoint our ex
pectations. Health and sickness, calm
and tempest, with an infinite number
of other accidents, whose causes are un
known and variable, have a great in
fluence both on the fortunes of parti
cular persons and on the prosperity of
public societies : and indeed all human
life, in a manner, depends on such ac
cidents. A being, therefore, who knows
the secret springs ofthe universe, might
easily, by particular volitions, turn all
these accidents to the good of mankind,
and
2o8 Dialogues concerning
Part and render the whole world happy,
^^j without discovering himself in any ope
ration. A fleet, whose purposes were
salutary to society, might always meet
with a fair wind : Good princes enjoy
found health and long life: Persons
born to power and authority, be fram
ed with good tempers and virtuous dis
positions. A few such events as these,
regularly and wisely conducted, would
change the face of the world ; and yet
would no more seem to disturb the
course of Nature, or confound human
conduct, than the present œconomy of
things, where the causes are secret, and
variable, and compounded. Some small
touches, given to Caligula's brain in
his infancy, might have converted him
into a Trajan : one wave, a little
higher than the rest,by burying Cæsar
and his fortune in the bottom of the
ocean, might have restored liberty to a
considerable part of mankind. There
may, for aught we know, be good rea

sons, why Providence interposes not in Pa*»
this manner ; but they are unknown to ^^
us : and though the mere supposition,
that such reasons exist, may be suffi
cient x.osa.'ve the conclusion concerning
the divine attributes, yet surely it can
never be sufficient to establish that con
clusion.
If every thing in the universe be con
ducted by general laws, and if animals
be rendered susceptible of pain, it scarce
ly seems possible but some ill must arise
in the various shocks of matter, and the
varioiis concurrence and opposition of
general laws : But this ill would be very
rare, were it not for the third circum
stance, which I proposed to mention,
viz. the great frugality with which all
powers and faculties are distributed to
every particular being. So well adjusted
are the organs and capacities of all ani
mals, and so well fitted to their preser
vation, that, as far as history or tradi
tion
2io Dialogues concerning
Part tion reaches, there appears not to be any
c^vj single species which has yet been extin
guished in the universe. Every animal
has the requisite endowments ; but these
endowments are bestowed with so scru
pulous an œconomy, that any conside
rable diminution must entirely destroy
the creature. Wherever one power is
increased, there is a proportional abate
ment in the others. Animals, which ex
cel in swiftness, are commonly defec
tive in force. Those which possess both,
are either imperfect in some of their
fenses, or are oppressed with the most
craving wants. The human species,
whose chief excellency is reason and sa
gacity, is of all others the most necessi
tous, and the most deficient in bodily
advantages ; without clothes, without
arms, without food, without lodging,
without any convenience of life, except
what they owe to their own skill and
industry. In short, Nature seems to
have formed an exact calculation of the
necessities
Natural Religion. ait
necessities of her creatures ; and, like a Part
rigid majier, has afforded them little
more powers or endowments than what
are strictly sufficient to supply those
necessities. An indulgent parent would
have bestowed a large stock, in order to
guard against accidents, and secure the
happiness and welfare of the creature
in the most unfortunate concurrence of
circumstances. Every course of life
would not have been so surrounded with
precipices, that the least departure from
the true path, by mistake or necessity,
must involve us in misery and ruin.
Some reserve, some fund, would have
been provided to ensure happiness ; nor
would the powers and the necessities
have been adjusted with so rigid an œco-
nomy. The Author of Nature is incon
ceivably powerful : his force is supposed
great, if not altogether inexhaustible:
nor is there any reason, as far as we can
judge, to make him observe this strict
frugality in his dealings with his crea
tures.

endowment. Almost all the moral, as

execution of every office and duty,
immediately follow; and men at once
may fully reach that state of society,
which is so imperfectly attained by the
best-regulated government. But as in
dustry is a power, and the most valu
able of any, Nature seems determined,
suitably to her usual maxims, to bestow
it on men with a very sparing hand; and
rather to punish him severely for his de
ficiency in it, than to reward him for his
attainments. She has so contrived his
O frame,
214 Dialogues concerni n
Part frame, that nothing but the most vib-
^v^ lent necessity can oblige him to labour;
and she employs all his other wants to
overcome, at least in part, the want of
diligence, and to endow him with some
share of a faculty, of which she has
thought fit naturally to bereave him.
Here our demands may be allowed
very humble, and therefore the more
reasonable. If we required the en
dowments of superior penetration and
judgment, of a more delicate taste of
beauty, of a nicer sensibility to bene
volence and friendship ; we might be
told, that we impiously pretend to break
the order of Nature ; that we want to
exalt ourselves into a higher rank of be
ing ; that the presents which we require,
not being suitable to our state and con
dition, would only be pernicious to us.

hard, that being placed in a world so

should also have our own temper to ^y^j
struggle with, and should be deprived
of that faculty which can alone fence
against these multiplied evils.
The fourth circumstance, whence a-^
rises the misery and ill of the universe,
is the inaccurate workmanship of all the
springs and principles of the great ma
chine.of nature. It must be acknow
ledged, that there are few parts of the
universe, which seem not to serve some
purpose, and whose removal would not
produce a visible defect and disorder in
the whole. The parts hang all toge-r
ther ; nor can one be touched without
affecting the rest, in a greater or less
degree. But at the same time, it must
be observed, that none of these parts or
principles, however useful, are so ac
curately adjusted, as to keep precisely
within those bounds in which their uti
lity consists ; but they are, all of them,
O 2 apt,
2i€ Dialogues concerning
P£*T apt, on every occasion, to run into the
*-o^ one extreme or the other. One would
imagine, that this grand production had
not received the last hand of the maker ;
so little finished is every part, and so
coarse are the strokes with which it is
executed. Thus, the winds are requi
site to convey the Vapours along the
surface of the globe, and to assist men
in navigation : but how oft, rising up
to tempests and hurricanes, do they be
come pernicious ? Rains are necessary
to nourish all the plants and animals of
the earth : but how often are they de
fective ? how often excessive ? Heat is
requisite to all life and vegetation ; but
is not always found in the due propor
tion. On the mixture and secretion of
the humours and juices of the body de
pend the health and prosperity of the
animal : but the parts perform not re
gularly their proper function. What
more useful than all the passions of the
mind, ambition, vanity, love, anger ?
But

But how oft do they break their bounds, Part
and cause the greatest convulsions in ^-^
society ? There is nothing so advan
tageous in the universe, but what fre
quently becomes pernicious, by its ex
cess or defect ; nor has Nature guarded,
with the requisite accuracy, against all
disorder or confusion. The irregula
rity is never, perhaps, so great as to
destroy any species ; but is often suffi
cient to involve the individuals in ruin
and misery.
On the concurrence, then, of these
four circumstances, does all or the
greatest part of natural evil depend.
Were all living creatures incapable of
pain, or were the world administered
by particular volitions, evil never could
have found access into the universe :

little ill in comparison ofwhat we feel at

on this occasion ? Shall we say, that
these circumstances are not necessary*
and that they might easily have been
altered in the contrivance of the uni
verse ? This decision seems too pre
sumptuous for creatures so blind and
ignorant. Let us be more modest in
our conclusions. Let us allow, that,
if the goodness of the Deity (I mean a
goodness like the human) could be esta
blished on any tolerable reasons apriori,
these phenomena, however untoward,
would not be sufficient to subvert that
principle ; but might easily, in some
unknown manner, bejeconcilable to it.
But let us still assert, that as this good
ness is not antecedently established, but
must be inferred from the phenomena,
there can be no grounds for such an
inference.,

inference, while there are so many ills Part
in the universe, and while these ills
might so easily have been remedied, as
far as human understanding can be
allowed to judge on such a subject. I
am Sceptic enough to allow, that the
bad appearances, notwithstanding all
my reasonings, may be compatible with
such attributes as you suppose : But
surely they can never prove these attri
butes. Such a conclusion cannot result
from Scepticism ; but must arise from
the phenomena^ and from our confi
dence in the reasonings which we de
duce from these phenomena.

appears in life. But if we consider, on
the other hand, the perfect uniformity

There may four hypotheses be fra
med concerning the first causes of the
Universe: that they are endowed with
perfect goodness ; that they have per

they have neither goodness nor malice.
Mixt phenomena can never prove the
two former unmixt principles. And the
uniformity and steadiness of general
laws seem to oppose the third. The
fourth,
222 Dialogues concerning

v^->j probable.
What I have said concerning natu
ral evil will apply to moral, with little
or no variation ; and we have no more
reason to infer, that the rectitude of the
Supreme Being resembles human recti
tude than that his benevolence resembles
the human. Nay, it will be thought,
that we have still greater cause to ex
clude from him moral sentiments, such
as we feel them ; since moral evil, in the
opinion of many, is much more predo
minant above moral good than natural
evil above natural good.

are strange topics, surely, to be so fondly

tors. In ages of stupidity and igno

tlemen. They know how to change their Part
style with the times. Formerly it was a _~oJ
most popular theological topic to main
tain, that human life was vanity and
misery, and to exaggerate all the ills and
pains which are incident to men. But
of late years, divines, we find, begin to
retract this position; and maintain,
though still with some hesitation, that
there are more goods than evils, more ,
pleasures than pains, even in this life.
When religion stood entirely upon tem
per and education, it was thought pro
per to encourage melancholy; as indeed,
mankind never have recourse to supe
rior powers so readily as in that dispo
sition. But as men have now learned
to form principles, and to draw conse
quences, it is necessary to change the
batteries, and to make use of such ar
guments as will endure at least some
scrutiny and examination. This varia

Our friend, I am afraid, said Clean-

Philo, I should rather wish to reason
with either of you apart on a subject
so sublime and interesting. Your spirit

228 Dialogues concerning

v^vO I am less cautious on the subject of Na
tural Religion than on any other; both
because I know that I can never, on that
head, corrupt the principles of any man
of common sense; and because no one,
I am confident, in whose eyes I appear
a man of common sense, will ever mis
take my intentions. You in particular,
Cleanthes, with whom I live in un
reserved intimacy ; you are sensible,
that, notwithstanding the freedom of
my conversation, and my love of singu
lar arguments, no one has a deeper sense
of religion impressed on his mind, or
pays more profound adoration to the
Divine Being, as he discovers himself to
reason, in the inexplicable contrivance
and artifice of Nature. A purpose, an
intention, a design, strikes every where
the most careless, the most stupid
thinker; and no man can be so harden
ed in absurd systems, as at all times to
reject it. That Nature does nothing in
vain,,
Natural Religion 229
vain, is a maxim established in all the j^j*
schools, merely from the contemplation ^v"*'
of the works of Nature, without any re
ligious purpose ; and, from a firm con
viction of its truth, an anatomists who
had observed a new organ or canal,
would never be satisfied till he had also
discovered its use and intention. One
great foundation of the Copernicant
system is the maxim, That Nature ails
by the simplejl methods, and chooses the most
proper means to any end ; and astrono
mers often, without thinking of it^ lay
this strong foundation of piety and re
ligion. The same thing is observable in
other parts of philosophy: And thus all
the sciences almost lead us insensibly to
acknowledge a first intelligent Author;
and their authority is osten so much the
greater, as they do not directly profess
that intention.
It is with pleasure I hear GalEN
reason concerning the structure of the

230 Dialogues concerning
Part human body. The anatomy of a man,
v*vO says he *, discovers above 600 different
muscles ; and whoever duly considers
these, will find, that in each of them
Nature must have adjusted at least ten
different circumstances, in order to at
tain the end which she proposed ; pro
per figure, just magnitude, right dispo
sition of the several ends, upper and;
lower position of the whole, the due in- ,
sertion of the several nerves, veins, and

above 6000 several views and intentions
must have been formed and executed.

the parts so artificially adjusted ? The
farther we advance in these researches,
we discover new scenes of art and wis
dom: But descry still, at a distance, far
ther scenes beyond our reach; in the
fine internal structure of the parts, in
the œconomy of the brain, in the fabric
of the seminal vessels. All these artifices
are repeated in every different species of
animal, with wonderful variety, and
with exact propriety, suited to the dif
ferent intentions of Nature in framing
each species. And if the infidelity of

ences were still imperfect, could not

Could I meet with one of this spe-

I would ask him : Supposing there were
a God, who did not discover himself
immediately to our senses ; were it pos
sible for him to give stronger proofs of
his existence, than what appear on the
whole face of Nature ? What indeed
could such a Divine Being do, but copy
the present œconomy of things ; render
many of his artifices so plain, that no
stupidity could mistake them; afford
glimpses of still greater artifices, which
demonstrate his prodigious superiority
above our narrow apprehensions ; and
conceal altogether a great many from
such imperfect creatures ? Now, accord
ing to all rules of just reasoning, every
fact must pass for undisputed, when it
is supported by all the arguments which
its nature admits of; even though these
arguments be not, in themselves, very
numerous or forcible: How much more,

and no understanding estimate their Part

I shall farther add, said Clean-
thes, to what you have so well urged,
that one great advantage of the prin-
ple of Theism, is, that it is the only sy
stem of cosmogony which can be ren
dered intelligible and complete, and yet
can throughout preserve a strong ana
logy to what we every day see and ex
perience in the world. The comparison
of the universe to a machine of human
contrivance is so obvious and natural,
and is justified by so many instances of
order and design in Nature, that it must
immediately strike all unprejudiced ap
prehensions, and procure universal ap
probation. Whoever attempts to weaken
this theory, cannot pretend to succeed
by establishing in its place any other
that is precise and determinate: It is
sufficient for him, if he start doubts and
difficulties ; and by remote and abstract

Part views of things, reach that suspense of
<wl> judgment, which is here the utmost
boundary of his wishes. But besides
that this state of mind is in itself unsa
tisfactory, it can never be steadily main
tained against such striking appearances
as continually engage us into the reli
gious hypothesis. A false, absurd sy-"
stem, human nature, from the force of
prejudice, is capable of adhering to with
obstinacy and perseverance: But no sy
stem at all, in opposition to a theory
supported by strong and obvious rea
son, by natural propensity, and by early
education, I think it absolutely impos
sible to maintain or defend.
So little, replied Philo, do I esteem
this suspense of judgment in the pre
sent case to be possible, that I am apt to
suspect there enters somewhat of a dis
pute of words into this controversy,
more than is usually imagined. That

iogy to the productions of art, is evident ; Pa*t
and according to all the rules of good ^yO
reasoning, we ought to infer, if we argue
at all concerning them, that their causes
have a proportional analogy. But as
there are also considerable differences,
we have reason to suppose a proportional
difference in the causes ; and in parti
cular ought to attribute a much higher
degree of power and energy to the su
preme cause than any we have ever ob
served in mankind. Here then the ex
istence of a DEITY is plainly ascertain
ed by reason : and if we make it a que
stion, whether, on account of these ana
logies, we can properly call him a mind
or intelligence, notwithstanding the vast
difference which may reasonably be
supposed between him and human
minds; what is this but a mere verbal
controversy ? No man can deny the
analogies between the .effects : To re
strain ourselves from inquiring con
cerning the causes, is scarcely possible:
P 4 From
236" Dialogues concerning
Part From this inquiry, the legitimate con
clusion is, that the causes have also an
analogy : And if we are not contented
with calling the first and supreme cause
a GOD or DEITY, but desire to vary
the expression ; what can we call him
but MIND or THOUGHT, to which
he is justly supposed to bear a consi
derable resemblance?
All men of sound reason are dis
gusted with verbal disputes, which a-
bound so much in philosophical and
theological inquiries ; and it is found,
that the only remedy for this abuse
muist arise from clear definitions, from
the precision of those ideas which en
ter into any argument, and from the
strict and uniform use of those terms
which ai*e employed. But there is a
species of controversy, which, from the
very nature of language and of human
ideas, is involved in perpetual am
biguity, and can never, by any pre
caution

caution or any definitions, be able to Part
reach a reasonable certainty or pre- ^^ii
cision. These are the controversies con
cerning the degrees of any quality or
circumstance. Men may argue to all
eternity, whether Hannibal be a
great, or a very great, or a superlatively
great man, what degree of beauty Cle
opatra possessed, what epithet of
praise Livy or Thucidydes is intitled
to, without bringing the controversy
to any determination. The disputants
may here agree in their sense, and differ
in the terms, or -vice versa ; yet never be
able to define their terms, so as to enter
into each others meaning : Because the
degrees of these qualities are not, like
quantity or number, susceptible of any
exact mensuration, which may be the
standard in the controversy. That the
dispute concerning Theism is of this
nature, and consequently is merely ver
bal, or perhaps, if possible, still more
incurably ambiguous, will appear upon
the*
238 Dialogues concerning
Part tlie slightest inquiry. I ask the Theist,
v^vO if he does not allow, that there is a great
and immeasurable, because incompre
hensible, difference between the human
and the divine mind : The more pious
he is, the more readily will he assent to
the .affirmative, and the more will he
be disposed to magnify the difference :
He will even assert, that the difference
is of a nature which cannot be too
much magnified. I next turn to the
Atheist, who, I assert, is only nomi
nally so, and can never possibly be in
earnest ; and I ask him, whether, from
the coherence and apparent sympathy
in all the parts of this world, there be
not a certain degree of analogy among
all the operations of Nature, in every
situation and in every age ; whether
the rotting of a- turnip, the generation
of an animal, and the structure of hu
man thought, be not energies that pro
bably bear some remote analogy to each
other : It is impossible he can deny it :

ving obtained this concession, I push
him still farther in his retreat ; and I
ask him, if it be not probable, that the
principle which first arranged, and still
maintains, order in this universe, bears
not also some remote inconceivable a-
nalogy to the other operations of Na
ture, and among the rest to the ceco-
nomy of human mind and thought.
However reluctant, he must give his
assent. Where then, cry I to both
these antagonists, is the subject of your
dispute? The Theist allows, that the
original intelligence is very different
from human reason : The Atheist al
lows, that the original principle of or
der bears some remote analogy to it.
Will you quarrel, Gentlemen, about
the degrees ; and enter into a contro
versy, which admits not of any precise
meaning, nor consequently of any de
termination ? If you mould be so ob
stinate, I should not be surprised to
find
240 Dialogues concerning
Part fin(j ytfu insensibly change sides ; while
v^rO the Theist, on the one hand, exaggerates
the dissimilarity between the Supreme
Being, and frail, imperfect, variable,
fleeting, and mortal creatures ; and the
Atheist, on the other, magnifies the a-
nalogy among all the operations of Na
ture, in every period, every situation,
and every position. Consider then,
where the real point of controversy lies ;
and if you cannot lay aside your dis
putes, endeavour, at least, to cure your
selves of your animosity.
And here I must also acknowledge,
Cleanthes, that, as the works of Na
ture have a much greater analogy to
the effects of our art and contrivance,
than to those of our benevolence and
justice; we have reason to infer, that
the natural attributes of the Deity have
a greater resemblance to those of men,
than his moral have to human virtues.
But what is the consequence ? Nothing
but
Natural Religion. 241
but this, that the moral qualities of Part
man are more defective in their kind
than his natural abilities. For as the
Supreme Being is allowed to be abso
lutely and entirely perfect; whatever
differs most from him, departs the far
thest from the supreme standard of rec
titude and perfection *.
These,
* It seems evident, that the dispute between the
Sceptics arid Dogmatists is entirely verbal ; or at least
regards only the degrees of doubt and assurance, which
we ought to indulge with regard to all reasoning : And
such disputes are commonly, at the bottom, verbal, and
admit not of any precise determination. No philosophi
cal Dogmatist denies, that there are difficulties both
with regard to the fenses and to all science ; and that
these difficulties are in a regular, logical method, abso
lutely insolveable. No Sceptic denies, that we lie under
an absolute necessity, notwithstanding these difficulties,
of thinking, and believing, and reasoning, with regard to
all kinds of subjects, and even of frequently assenting
with confidence and security. The only difference, then,
between these sects, if they merit that name, is, that
the Sceptic, from habit, caprice, or inclination, insists
most on the difficulties; the Dogmatist, for like reasons,
on the necessity.
242 Dialogues concerning
Part These, Cleanthes, are my un-
XII • . .
o-vO feigned sentiments on this subject ; and
these sentiments, you know, I have
ever cherished and maintained. But in
proportion to my veneration for true
religion, is my abhorrence of vulgar
superstitions ; and I indulge a peculiar
pleasure, I confess, in pushing such
principles, sometimes into absurdity,
sometimes into impiety. And you are
sensible, that all bigots, notwithstand
ing their great aversion to the latter a-
bove the former, are commonly equally
guilty of both.
My inclination, replied Cleanthes,
lies, I own, a contrary way. Religion,
however corrupted, is still better than
no religion at all. The doctrine of a
future state is so strong and necessary a
security to morals, that we never ought
to abandon or neglect it. For if finite
and temporary rewards and punish
ments have so great an effect, as we
daily
Natural Religion. 243
daily find ; how much greater must be Pa*t
expected from such as are infinite and
eternal ?
How happens it then, said Philo,
if vulgar superstition be so salutary to
society, that all history abounds so
much with accounts of its pernicious
consequences on public affairs ? Fac
tions, civil wars, persecutions, subver
sions of government, oppression, slave
ry; these are the dismal consequences
which always attend its prevalency over
the minds of men. If the religious
spirit be ever mentioned in any histori
cal narration, we are sure to meet after
wards with a detail of the miseries
which attend it. And no period of
time can be happier or more prosperous,
than those in which it is never regarded
or heard of.
The reason of this observation, re
plied Cleanthes, is obvious. The
proper
244 Dialogues concerning
Part proper office of religion is to regulate
^^j the heart of men, humanize their con
duct, infuse the spirit of temperance,
order, and obedience ; and as its ope
ration is silent, and only enforces the
motives of morality and justice, it is in
danger of being overlooked, and con
founded with these other motives.
When it distinguishes itself, and acts as
a separate principle over men, it has de
parted from its proper sphere, and has
become only a cover to faction and am
bition.
And so will all religion, said Philo,
except the philosophical and rational
kind. Your reasonings are more easily
eluded than my facts. The inference
is not just, because finite and tempo
rary rewards and punishments have so
great influence, that therefore such as
are infinite and eternal must have so
much greater. Consider, I beseech you,
the attachment which we have to pre
sent
Natural Religion. 245
sent things, and the little concern which ?£**
we discover for objects so remote and v-nr-»
uncertain. When divines are declaim
ing against the common behaviour and
conduct of the world, they always re
present this principle as the strongest
imaginable, (which indeed it is) ; and
describe almost all human kind as lying
under the influence of it, and sunk into
the deepest lethargy and unconcern a-
bout their religious interests. Yet these
same divines, when they refute their
speculative antagonists, suppose the mo
tives of religion to be so powerful, that,
without them, it were impossible for
civil society to subsist ; nor are they a-
shamed of so palpable a contradiction.
It is certain, from experience, that the
smallest grain of natural honesty and
benevolence has more effect on mens
conduct, than the most pompous views
suggested by theological theories and
systems. A man's natural inclination
works incessantly \ipon him ; it is for
Q^ ever
246 Dialogues concerning
Part ever present to the mind ; and mingles
itself with every view and considera
tion : whereas religious motives, where
they act at all, operate only by starts and
bounds ; and it is scarcely possible for
them to become altogether habitual to
the mind. The force of the greatest
gravity, say the philosophers, is infinite
ly small, in comparison of that of the
least impulse: yet it is certain, that the
smallest gravity will, in the end, pre
vail above a great impulse ; because no
strokes or blows can be repeated with
such constancy as attraction and gravi

Another advantage of inclination:
It engages on its side all the wit and in

every method and art of eluding them :
In which it is almost always successful.

cuses, with which people satisfy them- ^R*
selves, when they follow their inclina- ^>~j
tions in opposition to their religious
duty? This is well understood in the
world ; and none but fools ever repose
less trust in a man, because they hear,
that, from study and philosophy, he has
entertained some speculative doubts
with regard to theological subjects.
And when we have to do with a man,
who makes a great profession of reli

We must farther consider, that phi- '

flection, stand less in need of such mo

of morals : and that the vulgar, who
alone may need them, are utterly inca

the Deity to be pleased with nothing but
virtue in human behaviour. The re
commendations to the Divinity are ge
nerally supposed to be either frivolous
observances, or rapturous ecstasies, or a
bigotted credulity. We need not run
back into antiquity, or wander into re
mote regions, to find instances of this
degeneracy. Amongst ourselves, some
have been guilty of that atrociousness,
unknown to the Egyptian and Gre
cian superstitions, of declaiming, in
express terms, against morality ; and re
presenting it as a sure forfeiture of the
divine favour, if the least trust or reli
ance "be laid upon it.
But even though superstition or en
thusiasm should not put itself in direct
opposition to morality ; the very di
verting of the attention, the raising up
a new and frivolous species of merit,
the preposterous distribution which it
makes of praise and blame, must have
the

the most pernicious consequences, and **£"
weaken extremely mens attachment to ^^j
the natural motives of justice and hu
manity.
Such a principle of action likewise,
not being any of the familiar motives
of human conduct, acts only by inter
vals on the temper; and must be rouzed
by continual efforts, in order to render
the pious zealot satisfied with his own
conduct, and make him fulfil his devo
tional task. Many religious exercises
are entered into with seeming fervour,
where the heart, at the time, feels cold
and languid: A habit of dissimulation -^
is by degrees contracted : and fraud
and falsehood become the predominant
principle. Hence the reason of that
vulgar observation, that the highest zeal
in religion and the deepest hypocrisy,
so far from being inconsistent, are often
or commonly united in the same indi
vidual character.
(^3 The
250 Dialogues concerning

v-w-» in common life, are easily imagined :
but where the interests of religion are
concerned, no morality can be forcible
enough to bind the enthusiastic zealot.
The sacredness of the cause sanctifies
every measure which can be made use

The steady attention alone to so im
portant an interest as that of eternal
salvation, is apt to extinguish the bene
volent affections, and beget a narrow,
contracted selfishness. And when such
a temper is encouraged, it easily eludes
all the general precepts of charity and
benevolence.
Thus the motives of vulgar supersti
tion have no great influence on general
conduct; nor is their operation very fa
vourable to morality, in the instances
where they predominate.

certain and infallible, than that both

if the spirit of popidar religion were so
salutary to society, a contrary • maxim
ought to prevail. The greater number
of priests, and their greater authority
and riches, will always augment the re
ligious spirit. And though the priests
have the guidance of this spirit, why
may we not expect a superior sanctity
of life, and greater benevolence and
moderation, from persons who are set
apart for religion, who are continually
inculcating it upon others, and who
must themselves imbibe a greater share
of it ? Whence comes it then, that, in
fact, the utmost a wise magistrate can

for so humble a purpose is surrounded
with inconveniencies. If he admits only
one religion among his subjects, he must
sacrifice, to an uncertain prospect of
tranquillity, every consideration ofpub
lic liberty, science, reason, industry, and
even his own independency. If he gives
indulgence to several sects, which is the
wiser maxim, he must preserve a very
philosophical indifference to all of them,
and carefully restrain the pretensions of
the prevailing sect ; otherwise he can
expect nothing but endless disputes,
quarrels, factions, persecutions, and ci

True religion, I allow, has no such

Oaths are requisite in all courts of
judicature; but it is a question whether
their authority arises from any popular
religion. It is the solemnity and im
portance of the occasion, the regard to
reputation, and the reflecting on the
general interests of society, which are
the chief restraints upon mankind.
Custom-house oaths . and political oaths
are but little regarded even by some
who pretend to principles of honesty

but I know also, that Punic faith had
as bad a reputation in ancient times, as
Irish evidence has in modern; though
we cannot account for these vulgar ob
servations by the same reason. Not to
mention, that Greek faith was infa
mous before the rise of the Epicurean
philosophy; and Euripides f, in a pas
sage which I shall point out to you, has
glanced a remarkable stroke of satire
against his nation, with regard to this
circumstance.
Take care, Philo, replied Clean-
thes, take care: push not matters too
far: allow not your zeal against false
religion to undermine your veneration
for the true. Forfeit not this principle,
the chief, the only great comfort in life ;
and our principal support amidst all the
attacks of adverse fortune. The most
agreeable reflection, which it is possible
for

for human imagination to suggest, is p**?
that of genuine Theism, which repre- ^-^j
sents us as the workmanship of a Being
perfectly good, wise, and powerful ;
who created us for happiness; and who,
having implanted in us immeasurable
desires of good, will prolong our exist
ence to all eternity, and will transfer us
into an infinite variety of scenes, in or
der to satisfy those desires, and render
our felicity complete and durable. Next
to such a Being himself (if the compa
rison be allowed), the happiest lot which
we can imagine, is that of being under
his guardianship and protection.
These appearances, said Philo, are
most engaging and alluring ; and with
regard to the true philosopher, they are
more than appearances. But it happens
here, as in the former case, that, with
regard to the greater part of mankind,
the appearances are deceitful, and that

It is allowed, that men never have
recourse to devotion so readily as when
dejected with grief or depressed with
sickness. Is not this a proof, that the
religious spirit is not so nearly allied to
joy as to sorrow?
But men, when afflicted, find con
solation in religion, replied Cleanthes.
Sometimes, said Philo: but it is natu
ral to imagine, that they will form a
notion of those unknown beings, suit
ably to the present gloom and melan
choly of their temper, when they betake
themselves to the contemplation ofthem.
Accordingly, we find the tremendous
images to predominate in all religions;
and we ourselves, after having employ
ed the most exalted expression in our
descriptions of the Deity, fall into the
flattest contradiction, in affirming, that

I shall venture to affirm, that there
never was a popular religion, which re
presented the state of departed souls in
such a light, as would render it eligible
for human kind, that there should be
such a state. These fine models of reli
gion are the mere product of philoso
phy. For as death lies between the eye
and the prospect of futurity, that event
is so shocking to Nature, that it must
throw a gloom on all the regions which
lie beyond it ; and suggest to the gene
rality of mankind the idea of Cerberus
and Furies ; devils, and torrents of fire
and brimstone.
It is true, both fear and hope enter
into religion; because both these pas
sions, at different times, agitate the hu
man mind, and each of them forms a
ipecies of divinity suitable to itself. But
when
258 Dialogues concerning
Part when a man is in a cheerful disposition,
he is fit for business, or company, or
entertainment of any kind ; and he na
turally applies himself to these, and
thinks not of religion. When melan
choly and dejected, he has nothing to
do but brood upon the terrors of the
invisible world, and to plunge himself
still deeper in affliction. It may, indeed,
happen, that after he has, in this man
ner, engraved the religious opinions
deep into his thought and imagination,
there may arrive a change of health or
circumstances, which may restore his
good-humour, and raising cheerful pro
spects of futurity, make him run into
the other extreme of joy and triumph.
But still it must be acknowedged, that,
as terror is the primary principle of re
ligion, it is the passion which always
predominates in it, and admits but of
short intervals of pleasure.
Not to mention, that these fits of

for equal fits of superstitious terror and
dejection ; nor is there any state of mind
so happy as the calm and equable. But
this state it is impossible to support,
where a man thinks, that he lies, in such
profound darkness and uncertainty, be
tween an eternity of happiness and an
eternity of misery. No wonder, that
such an opinion disjoints the ordinary
frame of the mind, and throws it into
the utmost confusion. And though that
opinion is seldom so steady in its ope
ration as to influence all the actions ;
yet is it apt to make a considerable
breach in the temper, and to produce
that gloom and melancholy so remark

Such a sentiment implies both an absur
dity and an inconsistency. It is an absur
dity to believe that the Deity has hu
man passions, and one of the lowest of
human passions, a restless appetite for
applause. It is an inconsistency to be
lieve, that, since the Deity has this hu
man passion, he has not others also; and
in particular, a disregard to the opi

To know God, says Seneca, is to "wor

It degrades him to the low condition of

tery. Yet is this impiety the smallest
of which superstition is guilty. Com
